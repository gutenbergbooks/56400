<h2>PREFACE<br />
<span class="small">TO<br />
THE FIRST EDITION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In submitting to the Public a Memoir of a great man, it may
naturally be expected that an author should endeavour to convey
to them some idea of the associations, or other circumstances,
which have prompted the undertaking.</p>

<p>My father practised on the borders of a forest; and when he
was called at night to visit a distant patient, it was the greatest
treat to me, then a little boy, to be allowed to saddle my pony
and accompany him. My father knew the forest nearly as well as
his own garden; but still, in passing bogs in impenetrable darkness,
the more refined topography of a forester would be necessary;
and it was on one of these occasions that I first heard two
words, "Me-ward" and "Abernethy:" the one from our forester
guide, which I have never heard since, and the other which I
have heard more frequently perhaps than any. The idea I then
had of Abernethy was, that he was a great man who lived in London.
The next distinct impression I have of him was derived
from hearing my father say that a lady, who had gone up to
London to have an operation performed, had been sent by him to
Mr. Abernethy, because my father did not think the operation
necessary or proper; that Mr. Abernethy entirely agreed with
him, and that the operation was not performed; that the lady
had returned home, and was getting well. I then found that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
father had studied under him, and his name became a sort of
household word in our family. Circumstances now occurred
which occupied my mind in a different direction, and for some
years I thought no more of Abernethy.</p>

<p>As long as Surgery meant riding across a forest with my
father, I thought it a very agreeable occupation; but when I
found that it included many other things, I soon discovered there
was a profession I liked much better. Some years had rolled
away, when, one afternoon in October, about the year 1816, somewhat
to my own surprise, I found myself, about two o'clock,
walking down Holborn Hill, on my way to Mr. Abernethy's
opening lecture at St. Bartholomew's. Disappointed of being
able to follow the profession I had chosen, looking on the one I
was about to adopt with something very much allied to repulsion,
considering everything in this world "flat and unprofitable,"
and painfully depressed in spirits, I took my seat at the lecture.</p>

<p>When Mr. Abernethy entered, I was pleased with the expression
of his countenance. I almost fancied that he could
have sympathized with the melancholy with which I felt oppressed.
When he commenced, I listened with some attention; as he went
on, I began even to feel some pleasure; as he proceeded, I found
myself entertained; and before he concluded, I was delighted.
What an agreeable, happy man he seems! thought I. What a
fine profession! What would I give now to know as much as
he does! In short, I was converted.</p>

<p>Years again rolled on. I found myself in practice. Now, I
had an opportunity of proving the truth and excellence of the
beautiful principles I had been taught. I found how truthful had
been his representations of them. I was, however, grieved to find
that his opinions and views were very much misunderstood and
misrepresented; and I had very frequent opportunities of seeing
how much this restricted their application, and abridged their
utility.</p>

<p>Some few years after his death, I tried to induce some one to
endeavour to correct the erroneous impressions which prevailed in
regard to him; but to do Abernethy full justice, <i>would require a
republication of his works, with an elaborate commentary</i>. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
was a task involving too much time, labour, and expense, for any
individual to undertake; whilst anything less, however useful or
instructive to the public, must necessarily subject the author to a
criticism which few are disposed to encounter.</p>

<p>But as it appeared to me that scruples like these stood in the
way of that which was alike just to the memory of Abernethy and
useful to the public, I was resolved at all hazards to undertake at
least a Memoir myself. I shall say little of the difficulties of the
task. I feel them to have been onerous, and I believe them to
have been, in some respects, unexampled.</p>

<p>Apologies for imperfections in works which we are not obliged
to write, are seldom valued: the public very sensibly take a work
for what it is worth, and are ultimately seldom wrong in their
decision. I have only said thus much, not in deprecation of criticism,
so much as to show that I have not shrunk from what I
deemed just and useful, on account of the somewhat oppressive
sense I entertain of the risk or difficulty which it involves.</p>

<p>The scientific reader may, I fear, think that, in endeavouring
to avoid too tedious a gravity, I may sometimes have been forgetful
of the dignity of biographical memoir; but, in the difficulty
of having to treat of subjects which, however important, are not
always of the most popular kind, I have been obliged sometimes
to think of the "<i>quid vetat ridentem</i>." In the very delicate task
of discussing subjects relating to some of my contemporaries, I
have endeavoured simply to do Abernethy justice; and, beyond
what is necessary for that purpose, have avoided any quotations
or other matter calculated unnecessarily to revive or rekindle impressions
which may as well be dismissed or forgotten. It may
appear to some, that, in my remarks on the present state of professional
affairs, I have been too free. I can only say, that I have
stated exactly what I feel. I am earnestly desirous of seeing a
better state of things; but I have no idea that we can materially
improve that which we are afraid to examine.</p>

<p>I have to express my warmest thanks to several gentlemen for
the readiness with which they have contributed their assistance;
my most grateful acknowledgments to my respected friend, Mr.
Fowler of Datchet, and his son, Mr. Alfred Fowler, Mr. Thacker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
and Mr. Tummins of Wolverhampton&mdash;three of them being old
schoolfellows of Abernethy; to Mr. White, the distinguished
head master of Wolverhampton School, whose acceptable services
have been further enhanced by the ready kindness with which
they were contributed; to Mr. Belfour, the Secretary of the Royal
College of Surgeons, and Mr. Stone, the Librarian, I have to express
my best thanks for their kind assistance; and to the latter
especially, for many very acceptable contributions.</p>

<p>I have also to acknowledge the kind interest taken in the
work by Mr. Wood of Rochdale, Mr. Stowe of Buckingham&mdash;old
and distinguished pupils of Abernethy. My best thanks are
also due to Dr. Nixon of Antrim, not only for his own contributions,
but still more for the personal trouble he was so kind as
to take in relation to some particulars concerning the ancestors
of Mr. Abernethy; to Mr. Chevasse of Sutton Coldfield, for very
acceptable communications; and to Mr. Preston of Norwich.
Nor must I omit to express my obligation to several gentlemen
whom I have consulted at various times. My thanks are specially
due to Professor Owen. My old friends and fellow-pupils, Mr.
Kingdon, Mr. E. A. Lloyd, Dr. Barnett, Mr. Skey, and Mr. Welbank,
have shown as much interest in the work as their opportunities
allowed them, and will please to accept my best acknowledgments.</p>

<h2>PREFACE<br />
<span class="small">TO<br />
THE SECOND EDITION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The indulgent reception which the Public and the Profession
have been pleased to accord to these Memoirs having
already rendered a second edition necessary, the volumes have
been carefully revised. This has enabled me to correct some
typographical errors, and so to modify certain passages, that,
whilst the narrative remains essentially the same, it may be in
some points presented in an improved dress. I have also availed
myself of the opportunity of making some additions and corrections,
which, though few, are not unimportant.</p>

<p>Although not unacquainted with the fact that Mr. Abernethy
had declined the honour of a Baronetcy, no allusion was made to
it in the first edition; because I was not then in possession of
such evidence as appeared to me necessary in relation to a circumstance
that had not fallen within my own knowledge.</p>

<p>By the kindness of the family, I have been enabled to correct
an error in regard to those who were present in his last moments;
which, if in an historical point of view immaterial, is by no means
so with regard to the feelings of those whom it more immediately
concerns.</p>

<h2>PREFACE<br />
<span class="small">TO<br />
THE THIRD EDITION.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>In publishing a third edition of these Memoirs, I have to
express the grateful sense I entertain of the indulgence with
which they continue to be received.</p>

<p>Since the appearance of the second edition, Miss Abernethy
has kindly placed at my disposal the few papers which Mr. Abernethy
had preserved; and I trust that the additions they have
enabled me to make, may not prove unacceptable. Besides circumstances
of minor interest, interspersed through the volume,
there are some of great importance. The facts relating to the
marriage of Mr. Abernethy not only disprove a number of idle
reports, but offer another contribution to the general kindness
and sincerity of his character. In selecting a few extracts from
his thoughts on Religion and Morals, I have been desirous of
placing on record some of Mr. Abernethy's sentiments on these
all-important questions, without forgetting that I am writing the
Memoirs, not of a Divine, but of a <i>Philosophical Physiologist</i> and
<i>Surgeon</i>. In like manner, in the accompanying observations
which I have submitted on the relations of Science and Religion,
I have restricted myself to little more than a Layman's repudiation
of a vulgar error. Some little anxiety to impress this may
be excused, lest it should be supposed that an argument has been
stated in a few pages, which, even in an abridged form, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
require a volume; besides being inconsistent with the more measured
objects of a Biographical Memoir. I have carefully avoided
quoting any papers which, either by opinion or otherwise, reflected
on the conduct of any party; and I have taken some pains to
render this unnecessary. No man could be more sensitive than
Abernethy with regard to any imputation on his honour; but
that once satisfied, I am persuaded that nothing would have been
more unwelcome to him than that his Memoirs should have contained,
unnecessarily, one word that should offend any one; nor
anything more acceptable than its avoidance under circumstances
of provocation. I have had to contend with difficulties which I
need not particularize; it is far more agreeable to express the
gratitude I feel for that sympathy and assistance which have placed
papers and documents at my disposal, with a generous confidence
which, though scarcely easy sufficiently to appreciate, I trust it
is impossible knowingly to abuse.</p>

<p>Should it appear that, in my anxiety to avoid disagreeable
discussions, I have left any subject imperfectly handled, as regards
the high character of Mr. Abernethy, I should of course avail
myself of the documents now in my possession. I trust, however,
nothing of the kind may be necessary. Having long thought
it would be interesting to many persons, old pupils and others,
to record his manner in his later days, when delivering his Surgical
or Evening Lectures, as well as the position he was so
accustomed to assume when enunciating the fundamental axiom
of that improved Surgery of which he was the author, I have
added the lithograph at page 219. For this artistic sketch I am
indebted scarcely less to the painstaking than to the genius of the
late Mr. Charles Blair Leighton, who, as stated in the text, did not
live to realize those expectations of future excellence to which
his talents had given rise. Mr. Leighton, after a short illness,
died in May, 1855.</p>

</div>


<blockquote>
<p>"The Author of Nature appears deliberate throughout His operations, accomplishing
His natural ends by slow successive steps. And there is a plan of things
beforehand laid out, which, from the nature of it, requires various systems of
means, as well as length of time, in order to the carrying on its several parts into
execution."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Butler's Analogy.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>A retrospect of the history of human knowledge offers to
our contemplation few things of deeper interest than the evidence
it so repeatedly affords of some great law which regulates the
gradual development of truth, and determines the Progress of
Discovery.</p>

<p>Although knowledge has, at times, appeared to exhibit something
of uniformity in its advances, yet it cannot have escaped
the least observant that, as a whole, the Progress of Science has
been marked by very variable activity&mdash;at one time, marvellously
rapid; at another, indefinitely slow; now merged in darkness or
obscurity; and now blazing forth with meridian splendour.</p>

<p>We observe a series of epochs divided by intervals of great
apparent irregularity&mdash;intervals which we can neither calculate
nor explain; but which, nevertheless, exhibit a periodicity, which
the very irregularity serves to render striking and impressive.</p>

<p>We may remark, also, a peculiar fitness in the minds of those
to whom the enunciation of truth has been successively entrusted:
a fitness, not merely for the tasks which have been assigned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
each, as the special mission of the individual, but also in the relations
of different minds to each other. This adaptation to ends
which individual minds have unconsciously combined to accomplish,
might be illustrated by many examples, from the earliest
records of antiquity, down to our own times. This would be incompatible
with our present purpose. We will therefore only
refer to one or two illustrations, which, as being familiar, will
serve to show what we mean, and to lead us, not unnaturally, to
our more immediate object.</p>

<p>We cannot contemplate men like Bacon, Galileo, and Kepler,
for example, without feeling how auspicious the precession of such
minds must have been to the development of the genius of Newton<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor"><sup>1</sup></a>.
Newton was born the same year that Galileo died. There is
something very interesting and significant too in the peculiar powers
of Kepler. Prolific in suggestion, great in mathematical ability,
elaborate in analysis, and singularly truthful in spirit, Kepler
exemplified two things. These, though very distinct from each
other, were both equally instructive; both alike suggestive of the
link he represented in the chain of progress. In the laws he discovered,
he showed the harvest seldom withheld from the earnest
search for truth; but the enormous labour of the mode in which
he conducted his researches, as well as the limits prescribed to his
discoveries, exemplify the evils which, even in a man of the
greatest power, result from proceeding too much on hypothesis.
Now it is interesting to remember that this was coincident with
the dawning of that glorious light, the Inductive philosophy of
Bacon, and shortly succeeded by the splendid generalization of
Newton.</p>

<p>In like manner, if we think of the discoveries of Sir Humphrey
Davy&mdash;their nature and relations to physiology as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
chemistry,&mdash;we see how much there might have been that was
preparatory, and, to a mind like Davy's, suggestive, in the investigations
of preceding and contemporaneous philosophers. Priestly
had discovered oxygen gas; Galvani and Volta had shown those
remarkable phenomena which constitute that important branch of
knowledge, "Voltaic electricity;" Berzelius had effected the decomposition
of certain salts by the Voltaic pile; and Lavoisier
had even predicted as <i>probable</i> what Davy was destined to demonstrate<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>In medical science, few things have been more talked of than
the discovery of the circulation of the blood. Now it is curious
to observe that every fact essential to the demonstration of it had
been made out by previous investigators<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor"><sup>4</sup></a> but no one had deduced
from them the discovery of the circulation until Harvey,
although it was a conclusion scarcely more important than
obvious.</p>

<p>There is surely something very encouraging in the reflection,
that the advance of knowledge thus results from the accumulated
labours of successive minds. It suggests, that however unequally
the honours may appear to be distributed&mdash;however humble, in
our eyes, the function of those who unconsciously prepare the
way to great discoveries,&mdash;still it may involve a duty no less important
than the more lofty mission of enunciating them. The
importance of a man's mission can never be estimated by human
judgment. We can never know the mission; still less its relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
to the power, or the temptations by which that power has
been assailed. The most humble may here often approach as
nearly to his duty, as the most gifted may have fallen short of it.
Our faculties cannot penetrate the matter. We often see men
placed in positions for which they appear wholly unfitted&mdash;men
who seem to be bars to that progress which we should fancy it
their duty to promote. Again, we observe that almost all great
discoveries have to encounter opposition, persecution, obloquy,
or derision; and when they are established, a host of claimants
rise up to dispute the property with the rightful owner. A man
who is in earnest cares little for these things. They may at times
discourage and disappoint him; but they only strengthen his faith,
that a day will come when an unerring justice will accord to every
useful improvement its proper place and distinction.</p>

<p>Humanly speaking, we naturally ascribe discoveries to those
who have practically demonstrated them; but when we examine
all the clues which have been furnished by previous observers,
we frequently have misgivings as to the justice of our decisions.
In our admiration of the successful labour of the recent inquirer,
we sometimes forget the patient industry of the early pioneer.
With regard to those laws which govern the human body, we
cannot suppose that the development of them can be destined to
progress on any plan less determined than other branches of human
inquiry. But in all laws of nature we know that there are
interferences which, until explained, serve to obscure or altogether
to conceal the law from our view.</p>

<p>In relation to the Physiological laws, these interferences are
very numerous. 1st. Many are furnished by the physical laws;
many more arise from the connection of the physiological with
the moral laws, and especially from the abuse of (a responsible)
volition. These interferences, however, when their nature is
clearly developed, beautifully illustrate the laws they at first obscured;
for the common characters of subjects, in which the law
is usually exemplified, are brought out into higher relief by the
very diversities in the midst of which they occur. The progress
of mankind towards a popular familiarity with this fact, is necessarily
slow; but still we think it plainly perceptible. An individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
life, indeed, however distinguished, represents a mere point
in time; it affords little scope for considering, much less for estimating,
as they occur, the true meaning of various events, which
nevertheless ultimately prove to have had important influence on
the progress of knowledge.</p>

<p>These are world-wide things, which we must survey as the
geologist does the facts concerning which he inquires. We must
endeavour to combine, in one view, facts over which long periods
of time may have rolled away, with such as are still passing around
us. This will frequently suggest designs and relations altogether
unobservable by the mere abstract inquirer. In the course of
the following pages, a further opportunity may occur for a few
remarks on such views; the elaborate discussion of the subject
would be altogether beyond our present objects.</p>

<p>It will be our endeavour to point out the position occupied
by Abernethy, in that (as we trust) gradually dawning science,
to a particular phase of which our object and our limits will alike
restrict our attention. We mean that period when Surgery,
having approached to something like a zenith as a mere practical
<i>art</i>, began to exhibit, by slow and almost imperceptible degrees,
some faint characters of science&mdash;a shadowy commencement of a
metamorphose, which we believe promises to convert (though we
fear at a period yet distant) a monstrous hybrid of mystery and
conjecture into the symmetrical beauty of an Inductive science&mdash;a
science based on axioms and laws which are constantly exerting a
powerful influence on the social progress and the health of nations.</p>

<p>In considering Hunter and Abernethy, we shall see not only
a remarkable adaptation for the tasks in which they were respectively
engaged, but also how the peculiar defects of the one
were supplied by the characteristic excellences of the other. We
shall see that they cooperated in laying open clear and definite
objects; and that, though their modes of inquiry were far from
fulfilling the requisitions of an Inductive science, they were eminently
calculated to suggest the convenience, and impress the
necessity of it.</p>

<p>We no sooner begin to inquire with clear and definite purpose,
than we are led to the means necessary for the attainment of it.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<p>Abernethy himself, in speaking of the ordinary resources of
daily practice, used to say: "If a man has a clear idea of what
he desires to do, he will seldom fail in selecting the proper means
of accomplishing it."</p>

<p>So, in gathering the materials for building up a science, the
first thing is, to be clear as to those things in which it is deficient.
This once determined, all may lend assistance; and this very
division of labour, when directed with definite purpose, may
render even men most addicted to narrow and partial inquiries,
contributors to a great and common object.</p>

<p>In this way, those blows and discouragements so common in
the infancy of science, which test our motives and try our patience,
may prove tolerable when distributed over the many,
instead of proving, as is too common, depressing or destructive
when bearing only on the efforts of the few.</p>

<p>If we desire to shorten this labour, we need scarcely say there
is no way of doing it but by the adoption of that mode of proceeding
to which every other branch of science owes its present
position.</p>

<p>I mean the rigid suspension of all hypotheses, setting to work
by collecting <i>all</i> the facts in relation to the subject, and dealing
with them in strict compliance with the precepts of common
sense&mdash;or, what is the same thing, Inductive philosophy.</p>

<p>This will soon show us the just amount of the debt we owe to
Hunter and Abernethy; and, in leading us onwards, instructively
point out why these great men did not farther increase our obligations.</p>

<p>We shall see how the industry and circumspection of the
Argus-eyed Hunter, as Abernethy used to call him, enabled him
to unfold a legend in nature, which he had neither length of days,
sufficient opportunity, nor perhaps aptitude, wholly to decipher;
and how far it was developed into practical usefulness by the
penetrative sagacity and happy genius of Abernethy; which, like
light in darkness, guides and sustains immediate research, and
animates and encourages onward inquiry. To appreciate Abernethy,
however, it is necessary that the public should have correct
views at <i>least</i> of the <i>general</i> nature and objects of Medical Science.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>

<p>The public have not only a very real interest in acquiring a
sound common-sense view of the objects of medicine and surgery,
but a far deeper interest than it is possible for any one medical
man to have, merely as such, or all medical men put together.
This may, for the moment, appear startling to those who have
not been compelled to consider the subject; but the reader may
glean even from this volume, that so long as life or health, or even
money, has value, the remark is strictly true. From all sides
mankind have hitherto imbibed little but error. They have been
taught or induced to believe that the only objects of medicine
and surgery are to prevent or relieve diseases and accidents by
the astute employment of drugs, or by certain adroit manipulatory
or mechanical proceedings, and <i>par excellence</i> by "operations."
Now here is a great mistake&mdash;an idea so far from true, that
nothing can more delusively define, or more entirely conceal, the
higher objects of the science.</p>

<p>The direct contrary of the proposition would be nearer the
truth. It would be <i>more</i> correct to say that the object was to
relieve diseases and accidents by removing all interferences with
the reparative powers of nature; and that this was accomplished
more perfectly in proportion as we were enabled to <i>dispense</i> with
the employment of drugs, or the performance of operations.</p>

<p>The making the lame to walk, the blind to see, and the deaf
to hear, were chosen amongst the appropriate symbols of a
Divine Mission; and we need scarcely observe, that, in the restricted
sphere of human capacity, this is a portion of the mission
of every conscientious surgeon.</p>

<p>We may well, therefore, be dissatisfied with the narrow, not
to say degrading, definition of our duties too generally entertained;
but, on the other hand, if we would realize our claims to
these higher views of our calling, and enlarge the sphere of its
practical usefulness, we should recollect there is only one way
of attaining that object; and that is, by the applied interpretation
of those symbols, no less miraculous, no less certain
manifestations of Divine Power, the "Laws of Nature."
To name a science from something not essential to it, is like
naming a class of animals from some exceptional peculiarity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
in an individual. It is as if we would infer the mission of
the ocean wave from the scum sometimes seen on its surface; or
the purposes served by a feather, from the use we make of it
in writing, rather than from its common character of levity and
toughness; as if we treated an exception as a rule, or any other
manifest absurdity.</p>

<p>We have no opportunity of entering more fully into this important
distinction of the more lofty objects of our profession,
as contrasted with those usually assigned to it; we must therefore
rest satisfied in having awakened the reader's attention to the
subject, and proceed to the more ordinary objects of Biographical
Memoir.</p>

<p>John Abernethy was born in London, in the parish of St.
Stephen's, Coleman Street, on the 3rd of April, 1764, exactly
one year after John Hunter settled in London. It is also interesting
to remark, that Abernethy's first work, his "Surgical and
Physiological Essays"&mdash;Part I&mdash;was published the same year
that Hunter died, 1793; so that, whilst his birth occurred nearly
at the same time as the commencement of the more sustained investigations
of Hunter, his opening contribution to science was
coincident with the close of the labours of his illustrious friend
and predecessor.</p>

<p>The Abernethy family in their origin were possibly Scotch,
and formed one of those numerous inter-migrations between
Scotland and the north of Ireland, which, after lapse of time,
frequently render it difficult to trace the original stock. There
seems little doubt they had resided for some generations in
Ireland. John Abernethy, who was the pastor of a Coleraine
congregation, in 1688, was an eminent Protestant dissenting
minister, and the father of one still more distinguished. The
son (also named John) had been for some time pastor of the old
congregation of Antrim, whence he removed to Dublin about
the year 1733, to take charge of the Wood Street, now Strand
Street, Dublin. He is the author of several volumes of sermons,
which are not a little remarkable for clearness of thought, and
the earnestness of purpose, with which they inculcate practical
piety. He had a son who was a merchant, who subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
removed to London, and traded under the firm of Abernethy and
Donaldson, in Rood Lane, Fenchurch Street. This gentleman
married a lady whose name was Elizabeth Weir, daughter of
Henry and Margaret Weir, of the town of Antrim, and they
had two sons and three daughters.</p>

<p>James<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor"><sup>5</sup></a>, the elder brother, was also in business as a merchant,
and died about the year 1823. He was a man of considerable
talent, spoke with an accent suggestive of an Irish origin, and
was remarkable for his admiration and critical familiarity with
our immortal Shakspeare. He was probably born before his
father left Ireland. John, the second son, the subject of our
Memoir, was, as we have already said, born in London. The
register of his christening at St. Stephen's is as follows:</p>


<table summary="Christening">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdrr">Abernethy</td>
    <td class="tdll"><span class="xxxlarge">{</span></td>
    <td class="tdll">&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;1765.<br />John, son of<br />
                     John and Elizabeth,<br />&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;April, 24.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>This register would suggest that he was born a year later than
I have stated. I have, however, preferred 1764, as the year
adopted by his family; for although a man's birth is an occurrence
respecting the date of which he is not the very best
authority, he usually gets his information from those who are.
Besides, it was no uncommon thing at that time to defer the
christening of children for a much longer period. The education
of his early childhood was, most likely, altogether conducted at
home; but it is certain that, while yet very young, he was sent
to the Grammar School at Wolverhampton. Here he received
the principal part of his education; and though the records are
somewhat meagre, yet they tend to show that at an early age he
manifested abilities, both general and peculiar, which were indicative
of no ordinary mind; and which, though they do not
necessarily prefigure the future eminence at which he arrived, were
sufficiently suggestive of the probability that, whatever his career
might be, he would occupy a distinguished position.</p>

<p>Mankind naturally feel an interest in the boyhood of men
of genius; but it often happens that very little attention is paid
to early indications; and, when observed, it is certain that they
are often interpreted very falsely.</p>

<p>Nothing more emphatically suggests how much we have to
learn on this subject, than the obscurity which so often hangs
over the earlier years of distinguished men. At school, a number
of variable organizations are subjected to very much the
same influences; the necessity for generalization affords little opportunity
for individual analysis. The main road is broad and
familiar; there is no time for indulging in bye-paths, even should
the master have the penetration to perceive, in individual cases,
the expediency of such selection. Hence the quickening of those
impulses, on which the development of character so much depends,
is greatly a matter of uncertainty. The moment boys
leave school, on the contrary, this uniformity of external influences
is replaced by an interminable diversity; at home,
scarcely two boys being subjected to exactly the same. Thus, in
many instances, it would be easier to deduce the character of the
boy from the man, than to have predicted the man from the boy.
The evidences of the one are present to us, those of the other
may have been entirely unelicited, unobserved, or forgotten.</p>

<p>We cannot wonder, then, that expectation should have been
so often disappointed in the boy, or that excellences little dreamt
of should have been developed in the man.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>Dryden, who, regarded in the triple capacity of poet, prose-writer,
and critic, is hardly second to any English author, took
no honour at the University. Swift, perhaps our best writer of
pure English, whose talents proved scarcely less versatile and
extraordinary than they had appeared restricted and deficient,
was "plucked" for his degree, in Dublin, and only obtained his
recommendation to Oxford "<i>speciali gratia</i>" as it was termed.
The phrase, however, being obviously equivocal, and used only in
the bad sense at Dublin, was, fortunately for Swift, interpreted in
a good sense at Oxford&mdash;a misapprehension which Swift, of course,
was at no pains to remove.</p>

<p>Sheridan was remarkable for his readiness, his invention, and
his wit; as a writer, he showed considerable powers of sustained
thought also. He had an habitual eloquence, and, on one occasion,
delivered an oration before one of the most distinguished
audiences that the world ever saw<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor"><sup>6</sup></a>, with an effect that seems to
have rivalled the most successful efforts of Cicero, or even Demosthenes.
Yet he had shown so little capacity as a boy, that he
was presented to a tutor by his own mother with the complimentary
accompaniment that he was an incorrigible dunce.</p>

<p>Some boys live on encouragement, others seem to work best
"up stream." Niebuhr, the traveller, the father of a son no less
illustrious, with anything but an originally acute mind, seems to
have overcome every disadvantage which the almost constant
absence of opportunity could combine. Those who are curious
in such matters might easily multiply examples of the foregoing
description, and add others where&mdash;as in the case of Galileo,
Newton, Wren, and many others&mdash;the predictions suggested by
early physical organization proved as erroneous as the intellectual
indications to which we have just adverted.</p>

<p>The truth is, we have a great deal to learn on the subject of
mind, although there is no want of materials for instruction.
Medicine and surgery are not the only branches of knowledge
which require the aid of strictly inductive inquiry. In all, the
materials (facts) are abundant.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p>In Abernethy there was a polarity of character, an individuality,
a positiveness of type, which would have made the boy
a tolerably intelligible outline of the future man. The evidence
is imperfect; it is chiefly drawn from the recollections of a living
few, who, though living, have become the men of former days;
but still the evidence all inclines one way.</p>

<p>We can quite imagine a little boy, "careless in his dress, not
slovenly," with his hands in his pockets, some morning about the
year 1774, standing under the sunny side of the wall, at Wolverhampton
Grammar School<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor"><sup>7</sup></a>; his pockets containing, perhaps,
a few shillings, some halfpence, and a knife with the point
broken, a pencil, together with a tolerably accurate sketch of
"Old Robertson's" wig. This article, as shown in an accredited
portrait<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor"><sup>8</sup></a> now lying before us, was one of those enormous bygone
bushes which represented a sort of impenetrable fence
round the cranium, as if to guard the precious material within.
The said boy just finishing a story to his laughing companions,
though no sign of fun appeared in him, save a little curl of the
lip, and a smile which would creep out of the corner of his eye
in spite of him. I have had the good fortune to find no less than
three schoolfellows of Abernethy, who are still living: John
Fowler, Esq. of Datchet, a gentleman whom I have had the
pleasure of knowing for many years, and who enjoys, in honourable
retirement at his country seat, at the age of eighty-two, the
perfect possession of all his faculties; William Thacker<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor"><sup>9</sup></a>, Esq. of
Muchall, about two miles from Wolverhampton, who is in his
eighty-fifth year; T. Tummins, Esq. of King Street, Wolverhampton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
who is in his eighty-seventh year. To these gentlemen,
and to J. Wynn, Esq. also of Wolverhampton, I am
principally indebted for the few reminiscences I have been able
to collect of the boyish days of Abernethy.</p>

<p>The information which I gained from Mr. Fowler, he gave
me himself; he also kindly procured me a long letter from Mr.
Wynn. The reminiscences of Mr. Tummins and Mr. Thacker, I
have obtained through the very courteous and kind assistance of
the Rev. W. White, the late<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor"><sup>10</sup></a> distinguished head master of the
Wolverhampton School.</p>

<p>To all of these gentlemen I cannot too strongly express my
thanks, for the prompt and kind manner in which they have
replied to all the enquiries which have been addressed to them.
The following are the principal facts which their letters contain,
or the conclusions they justify. Abernethy must have gone to
Wolverhampton when very young, probably; I should say certainly
before 1774. He was brought by Dr. Robertson from London,
with another pupil, "his friend Thomas;" and the "two Londoners"
boarded with Dr. Robertson. When Mr. Fowler went
there in 1778, Abernethy was high up in the school, and ultimately
got to the head of the senior form. He must have left Wolverhampton
in all probability not later than 1778, because Dr.
Robertson resigned the head mastership in that year; and we
know that in the following (1779), when he was fifteen, Abernethy
was apprenticed to Sir Charles Blicke.</p>

<p>Mr. Thacker says he was very studious, clever, a good scholar,
humorous, but very passionate. Mr. Tummins, Mr. Thacker
says, knew Abernethy well. Abernethy used to go and dine
frequently with Mr. Tummins's father. Mr. Tummins says
"Abernethy was a sharp boy, a very sharp boy, and a very
passionate one too. Dr. Robertson," he says, "was also a
very passionate man."</p>

<p>One day, Abernethy had to "do" some Greek Testament;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
and it appeared that he set off very glibly, having a "crib" in
the shape of a Greek Testament, with a Latin version on the other
side. The old Doctor, suspecting the case, discovered the crib,
and the pupil was instantly "levelled with the earth." This
<i>fortiter in re</i> plan of carrying the intellect by a <i>coup-de-main</i>,
has, as the late head master observed, been replaced by more
refined modes of proceeding. The more energetic plan was (however
coarse and objectionable) not always unsuccessful in implanting
a certain quantity of Latin and Greek. Abernethy was a
very fair Latin scholar, and he certainly had not, at one period, a
bad knowledge of Greek also.</p>

<p>There are, however, many other things to be learnt besides
Latin and Greek; and it is probable that the more measured
reliance on such violent appeals, which characterizes modern
education, might have been better suited to Abernethy. To a
boy who was naturally shy, and certainly passionate, such mechanical
illustrations of his duty were likely to augment shyness
into distrust, and to exacerbate an excitable <i>temper</i> into an irritable
<i>disposition</i>.</p>

<p>Abernethy, in chatting over matters, was accustomed jocularly
to observe that, for his part, he thought his mind had, on some
subjects, what he called a "<i>punctum saturationis</i>;" so that "if
you put anything more into his head, you pushed something out."
If so, we may readily conceive that this plan of forcing in the
Greek, might have forced out an equivalent quantity of patience
or self-possession. It is difficult to imagine anything less appropriate
to a disposition like Abernethy's than the discipline in
question. It was, in fact, calculated to create those very infirmities
of character which it is the object of education to correct
or remove.</p>

<p>It seems that neither writing nor arithmetic were taught in
the school; and "Tummins and Abernethy" used to go to learn
these matters at the school of a Miss Ready, in King Street,
Wolverhampton. This lady appears to have had, like Dr. Robertson,
a high opinion of what the profession usually term "local
applications" in the conduct of education. Many years afterwards,
she called upon Mr. Abernethy. He was then in full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
practice in London. He received her with the greatest kindness,
begged her to come and dine with him as often as she could
while she stayed in London; and, introducing her to Mrs. Abernethy,
said: "I beg to introduce to you a lady who has boxed
my years many a time."</p>

<p>Had Miss Ready, however, heard us call in question the
necessity of this association of boxing ears and quill-driving, she
would probably have retorted on us, that few men wrote so good
a hand as John Abernethy. It is certain that, <i>brusque</i> as the
discipline might have been, or ill-suited to the disposition of
Abernethy, it did not interfere with the happiness of his
schoolboy life. He always looked back to his days at Wolverhampton
with peculiar pleasure, and seemed to regard every association
with the place with affectionate remembrance.</p>

<p>Mr. Wynn observes, in his letter: "About twenty years ago
I accompanied a patient to Mr. Abernethy. After prescribing,
he said, 'let me see you again in about a week,' 'We cannot,
for we are returning into the country.' 'Why, where do you
live?' 'Wolverhampton.' 'Wolverhampton? Why, I went
to school there. Come, sit down, and tell me who's alive and
who's dead.' After running over the names of some of the old
families, their health, circumstances, &amp;c. he wished us good
morning, saying, 'Ah! I cannot forget Wolverhampton!'"</p>

<p>Mr. Thacker's note I subjoin, written in a good firm hand, at
eighty-five.</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="sigright in0">"Muchall, near Wolverhampton,<br />
"May 17, 1852.</p>

<p class="sigleft in0">"Sir,</p>

<p>"As a boy, I remember John Abernethy and William Thomas
coming from London to board with, and as scholars to, Dr.
Robertson, the head master of the Wolverhampton School, in
which there were two masters, both clergymen. We were
formed into several classes, in which John Abernethy, William
Thomas, Walter Acton Mosely, and myself, formed one. Abernethy
took the head or top of the class; but the boys used to
change places in the classes according to their proficiency; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
I do not recollect that Abernethy ever took a third place in the
class. So also in his sports, he usually made a strong side, for
he was remarkably quick and active, and soon learned a new
game. He had but one fault that I knew of&mdash;he was rather
hasty and impetuous in his manner, but it was soon over and
forgotten.</p>

<p>"The 'Doctor,' as we used to call him (Robertson), had a
daughter grown up, and she used to hear the boarders in the
house read plays before her father, in which, in particular
passages, she showed where the emphasis should be laid, and
how to pronounce the same properly; this occasioned the use
of the play of 'Cato,' and originated the boys' performance of
that play in the school-room before their fathers and friends.
I do not remember the part that Abernethy took in that play.
I have applied to Mr. Tummins of Wolverhampton, but his
memory does not supply information. He knew Mr. Abernethy
well.</p>

<p>"If I recollect any others of my schoolfellows who knew
him, I will apply to them for information, and communicate the
same to you immediately.</p>

<p class="sigright in0">"I am, Sir,&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;<br />
"Your obedient servant,&#8195;<br />
"<span class="smcap">William Thacker</span>.</p>

<p class="sigleft in0">To George Macilwain, Esq."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>We learn from another reminiscent, that in the play at
Wolverhampton Abernethy took a "principal part." He certainly
had a good deal of dramatic talent, in the highest sense of the
word; and, as will be seen in the sequel, could light up a story
with rich humour, or clothe it with pathos, as suited the occasion,
with equal facility. Scanty as they are, there is much in these
school reminiscences significant of his future character.</p>

<p>As we have observed, Abernethy left Wolverhampton in 1778.
He was then head of the school, a quick, clever boy, and more
that an average scholar. He returned to London, that world of
hopes, fears, and anxieties; that spacious arena, on which all are
desirous of entering as competitors who are ambitious of professional
or commercial distinction.</p>

<p>Circumstances, in themselves apparently unimportant, often
determine the selection of a profession. Few boys can do exactly
what they please, and the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> are seldom placed before
them in a way to assist them in determining the just value of the
reasons on which their choice may have proceeded. They are
not, indeed, unfrequently dealt with as if, whilst not incompetent
to make choice of a profession, they were held incapable of
weighing the circumstances by which alone such choice could be
judiciously directed. The absurdity of this appears, when we
think a moment of what it involves, which is nothing less than
expecting them to do what is impossible; viz. to form an opinion
on a subject when the main facts in relation to it are withheld
from them. Be this as it may, every day shows us that men are
too frequently dissatisfied with the profession which they follow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>

<p class="in0">is just as applicable as ever; and although human nature has
almost everything ascribed to its natural infirmities, yet it appears
quite as sensible, and not a whit less humble, to conclude, that
paths chosen without consideration naturally lead to disappointment.
The evil, like most others, carries with it the elements of
self correction.</p>

<p>Parents are slow to encourage their children to select paths
which they themselves have trodden with regret. This tends to
distribute their professions to other families. Mutual interchanges
of this kind serve to protect the interests of society, by, in some
degree, limiting the number of cases in which men have failed to
select the pursuits best adapted to them.</p>

<p>In almost all pursuits of life, success is determined, much
more than many are disposed to imagine, by the homely qualities
of steadiness and industry. We are apt&mdash;and sometimes not
improperly&mdash;to ascribe peculiar <i>excellence</i> to peculiar powers.
Yet the more insight we obtain into the histories of men, the
more we perceive how constantly the most brilliant have been
aided by the more homely qualifications to which we have adverted.</p>

<p>No doubt some minds are so constituted as to be moderately
certain of success or distinction in almost any pursuit to which
they might have been directed; and we are disposed to think
that Abernethy's was a mind of that order; but there is abundant
evidence to show that his talents were at least equalled by his
industry. One paper of his, which contains a beautiful and discriminative
adjustment of a difficult point of practice in Injuries of
the Head&mdash;which contains no intrinsic evidence of such industry&mdash;was
not published until after he had attended to every serious
injury of the head in a large hospital for almost twenty years;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
besides examining the bodies of all the fatal cases. Nor can we
estimate this industry properly, without recollecting that all this
time he was only an <i>assistant surgeon</i>, whose duties, for the <i>most</i>
part, neither required nor <i>permitted</i> him to do more than to
<i>observe</i> the treatment; and that, therefore, the whole of this
industry was simply in the character of a student of his profession<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor"><sup>12</sup></a>.
All biography is full of this kind of evidence; and art,
as well as science, furnishes its contribution. Who could have
imagined that the peculiar, chaste composition, the easy and
graceful touch of Sir Augustus Callcott, could have owed so
much to industry as it undoubtedly must have done? It is
known, for example, that he made no less than forty different
sketches in the composition of one picture. We allude to his
"Rochester." Had Abernethy been allowed to choose his profession,
he, no doubt, would have selected the Bar. It is
impossible to reflect on the various powers he evinced, without feeling
that, had he followed the law, he would have arrived at a
very distinguished position. "Had my father let me be a lawyer,"
he would say, "I should have known every Act of Parliament by
heart." This, though no doubt intended as a mere figure of speech,
was not so far from possibility as might be imagined, for it referred
to one of his most striking characteristics; viz. a memory
alike marvellously ready, capacious, and retentive&mdash;qualities
common enough separately, but rare in powerful combination.</p>

<p>We may have opportunities by and by, perhaps, of further
illustrating it. We will give one anecdote here. A gentleman,
dining with him on a birthday of Mrs. Abernethy's, had composed
a long copy of verses in honour of the occasion, which he
repeated to the family circle after dinner. "Ah!" said Abernethy,
smiling, "that is a good joke, now, your pretending to have
written those verses." His friend simply rejoined, that, such as
they were, they were certainly his own. After a little good-natured
bantering, his friend began to evince something like annoyance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
at Abernethy's apparent incredulity; so, thinking it
was time to finish the joke, "Why," said Abernethy, "I know
those verses very well, and could say them by heart<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor"><sup>13</sup></a>." His friend
declared it to be impossible; when Abernethy immediately repeated
them throughout correctly, and with the greatest apparent
ease. To return. However useful this quality might have been
at the Bar, Abernethy was destined to another course of life&mdash;a
pathway more in need, perhaps, of that light which his higher
qualifications enabled him to throw over it, and which "his
position" "in time" afforded him an opportunity of doing just
when it seemed most required. He probably thus became, both
during life and prospectively, the instrument of greater good to
his fellow-creatures than he would have been in any other station
whatever.</p>

<p>I have not been able to discover what the particular circumstances
were which determined his choice of the medical profession.
It is probable that they were not very peculiar. A boy
thwarted in his choice of a profession, is generally somewhat
indifferent as to the course which is next presented to him; besides,
as his views would not have been opposed but for some
good reason, a warm and affectionate disposition would induce
him to favour any suggestion from his parents. Sir Charles
Blicke was a surgeon in large practice; he lived at that time in
Mildred's Court, and Abernethy's father was a near neighbour,
probably in Coleman Street.</p>

<p>Abernethy had shown himself a clever boy, a good scholar;
and he was at the top of Wolverhampton School before he was
fifteen. Sir Charles Blicke was quick-sighted, and would easily
discover that Abernethy was a "sharp boy." All that Abernethy
probably knew of Sir Charles, was, that he rode about in his
carriage, saw a good many people, and took a good many fees,
all of which, though perhaps presenting no particular attractions
for Abernethy, made a <i>primâ facie</i> case, which was not repulsive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Accordingly, in the year 1779, being then fifteen years of age, he
became bound an apprentice to Sir Charles, and, probably, for
about five years.</p>

<p>This first step, this apprenticing, has a questionable tendency
as regards the interests of the public and the profession. It
exerts, also, a considerable influence on the character and disposition
of the boy, which we must by and by consider. It is
a mode of proceeding which, we fear, has done not a little to
impede the progress of surgery as a science, and to maintain that
handicraft idea of it suggested by the etymology of the word.
Where one man strikes out a new path, thousands follow the
beaten track. A boy, with his mind ill-prepared, having no
<i>definite</i> ideas of the nature and objects of scientific inquiries,
and almost certainly uninstructed as to the rules to be observed
in conducting them&mdash;knowing neither any distinction between an
art and a science&mdash;a boy thus conditioned is bound for a certain
number of <i>years</i>! to a man of whom he knows little, and to a profession
of which he knows nothing. He takes his ideas and his
tone from his master; or, if these be repulsive to him, he <i>probably
adopts an opposite extreme</i>. If the master practise his profession
merely as an art, he furnishes his pupil with little more than a
string of conventionalisms; of which, if the pupil has talent
enough to do anything for himself, he is tolerably certain to have
a great deal to unlearn.</p>

<p>We believe the system is in course of improvement; it is
high time it was put an end to altogether. Apprenticeships
might not have been an inauspicious mode of going to work in
former times, when there existed barber-surgeons. This alliance
of surgery and shaving, to say nothing of the numerous other
qualifications with which they were sometimes associated, might
conceivably enough have furnished some pretext for apprenticeships;
since Dickey Gossip's definition of</p>

<p class="in0">was by no means always sufficiently comprehensive to include the
multifarious accomplishments of "the doctor." I have myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
seen, in a distant part of this island, within twenty-five years,
chemist, druggist, surgeon, apothecary, and the significant &amp;c.
followed by the hatter, hosier, and linen-draper, in one establishment;
but as we shall have to discuss this subject more fully in relation
to Abernethy in another place, we may proceed.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Blicke had a large and lucrative practice. He
had the character of taking care to be well remunerated for his
services. He amassed a considerable fortune; but we incline to
think that the ideas of the profession which Abernethy derived
from his experience of his apprenticeship were not very
favourable. The astute, business-like mode of carrying on the
profession, which seems to have characterized Sir Charles Blicke's
practice, could have had few charms for Abernethy. Mere money-making
had never at any time much attraction for him, and, at
that period of his life, probably none at all; whilst the measured
pretensions of surgery to anything like a science could hardly have
been, at times, otherwise than repulsive.</p>

<p>The tone in which he usually spoke of Sir Charles's practice
did not convey a very favourable idea of the impression which it
had left on him. In relating a case, he would say: "Sir Charles
was at his house in the country, where he was always on the look
out for patients." On another occasion, speaking of patients becoming
faint under peculiar circumstances, he observed: "When
I was an apprentice, my master used to say: 'Oh, Sir! you are
faint; pray drink some of this water.' And what do you think
was the effect of his putting cold water into a man's stomach under
these circumstances? Why, of course, that it was often rejected
in his face."</p>

<p>Sir Charles's manipulatory and operative proceedings seem,
however, to have represented a tolerably adroit adoption of the
prevailing modes of practice; while his medical surgery consisted
chiefly of the empirical employment of such remedies as he had
found most frequently successful, or, at all events, somehow or
other associated with a successful issue; with the usual absence
of any investigation of the cause of either success or failure.
By a mind like Abernethy's, this sort of routine would be very
soon acquired, and, in a short time, estimated at its real value.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Still, while a clear head is all that is necessary to the reception
of what may be positive and truthful, it requires a vivid perception
and a cultivated understanding to detect error. Many things,
however, would creep out in Abernethy's lectures, showing that,
young as he was, even during his apprenticeship, he was not only
a real student, but he had begun to think for himself.</p>

<p>He mentions a case of "Locked-jaw," that occurred as early
as 1780 (the first year of his apprenticeship), which he appears
to have noted with great accuracy. He mentions the medicine
that was given to the man, the unusually large doses, and, lastly,
the enormous quantity of it which was found in the stomach after
death. It was opium, and amounted to many drachms.</p>

<p>We also find him engaged in inquiries involving much more
extended views than were in that day <i>generally</i> associated with
the study of <i>surgery</i>. He very early participated in those researches
which had for their object to determine the relation of
the digestive functions to one of the most recondite affections of
an extremely important organ (the kidney).</p>

<p>"When I was a boy," said he, "I half ruined myself in buying
oranges and other things, to ascertain the effects of different kinds
of diet in this disease."</p>

<p>The same researches show how early also he began to perceive
the importance of chemistry in investigating the functions of
different organs, and in <i>aiding</i>, generally, physiological researches.
We have heard a contemporary and a lecturer on chemistry attest
Abernethy's proficiency in that science. As his investigations
proceeded, he had the still higher merit of taking <i>just and sober
views</i> of the relations of chemistry to physiological science.</p>

<p>We mean that whilst he fully recognized the importance of
it, he entirely avoided that <i>exclusive</i> reliance on it which is too often
created by some of the more striking demonstrations of chemical
science; that one&mdash;idea&mdash;tendency, which unconsciously wrests
it to the solution of phenomena which, in the <i>present state</i> of our
knowledge, it is wholly inadequate to explain. We have alluded
to the foregoing facts touching the impressions derived from his
apprenticeship, and his early disposition for philosophical research,
because both will be found to have relations to his subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
labours and peculiarities. Diligent as he was, we suspect he found,
during his apprenticeship, little of those attractions which make
labour and industry sources of happiness and pleasure.</p>

<p>As a matter of course, he would have been allowed to attend
any lectures which were given at the hospital to which Sir Charles
Blicke was surgeon (St. Bartholomew's), and this would bring
him in contact with Mr. Pott, who delivered a certain number
of surgical lectures there.</p>

<p>There were no <i>courses</i> of anatomical lectures given at St. Bartholomew's
at that period; but anatomical lectures were delivered
regularly at the London Hospital, by Dr. Maclaurin and Sir
William Blizard, and afterwards by Sir William Blizard alone.
As Sir Charles Blicke lived in Mildred's Court and subsequently
in Billiter Square, Abernethy would be about equidistant from
the two hospitals, both of which he attended. We incline to
think that it was in attending these lectures, and perhaps especially
those of Sir William Blizard, that he first found those awakening
impulses which excited in him a real love for his profession.</p>

<p>It was about this time, we think, that he began to have more
enlarged ideas of the nature and objects of surgical science; a
state of mind calculated to enable him to thoroughly understand
and appreciate Mr. Hunter, and to deduce from the principles
which he was shadowing forth, those relations and consequences
which we shall endeavour popularly to explain; principles which,
though originally directed to the treatment of so-called surgical
maladies, were found equally to affect the practice of medicine.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>


<blockquote>
<p>"There is not a more pleasing exercise of the mind than gratitude. Were
there no positive command which enjoined it, nor any recompense laid up for it
hereafter, a generous mind would indulge in it, for the natural gratification
which accompanies it."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Addison.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Sir William Blizard was an eminent surgeon and an enthusiastic
student of the profession, as studied in his day. He
had a certain bluntness of manner, which was not unkind neither.
He was very straightforward, which Abernethy liked; and he had
nothing of a mercenary disposition, which Abernethy held in abhorrence.
He was a kind of man very likely to excite in one of
Abernethy's tone of mind many agreeable impressions. He early
perceived the talents, and was probably the first to encourage the
industry, of his distinguished pupil. Enthusiastic himself, he
had the power of communicating a similar feeling to many of his
pupils; and he appears to have contributed one of those impulses
to Abernethy which are from time to time necessary to sustain
the pursuit of an arduous profession.</p>

<p>Some men seem to like anatomy for its own sake; examinations
of structure merely, by dissection, or the microscope, have
a kind of intrinsic charm for them. This was not the case with
Abernethy. <i>Mere</i> anatomy had few charms for him. He regarded
it in its true light, as a means to an end; as the basis on
which he could alone found, not only the more common or handicraft
duties of surgery, but also those higher views which aim at
developing the uses and relations of the various organs; and in
this way to ascertain what the processes of nature are in the preservation
of health and the <i>conduct of disease</i>; in short, a knowledge
of what he called physio-pathology.</p>

<p>Sir William, therefore, in exciting Abernethy's enthusiasm at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
this time, was probably of great service. He was thus impelled
to pursue the study of anatomy, which perhaps might otherwise
have failed to interest him sufficiently, whilst his attention was by
no means diverted from the real purposes of that study. On the
contrary, he always saw anatomy, as it were, through a physiological
medium. This threw a pleasure into his anatomical pursuits,
and was <i>one</i> of the means by which, in his own lectures, he
contrived to impart an interest to the driest parts of our studies.</p>

<p>Many years afterwards, he was fond of illustrating the true
relations of anatomy and physiology, and at the same time contrasting
the attractions of the one with the comparatively repulsive
requisitions of the other, by saying, with Dr. Barclay, of
Edinburgh, that "he never would have wedded himself to so
ugly a witch (anatomy), but for the dower she brought him
(physiology)." The impressions which he derived from Sir William
Blizard were deep and durable. More than thirty years
after, when he himself was at the zenith of his career, we find his
grateful feeling towards Sir William still glowing warm as ever.
He seems to have considered the expression of it as the most
appropriate opening to the first of the beautiful lectures which
he delivered at the College of Surgeons in 1814. It must have
been a moment of no small gratification to Sir William, who was
present, now venerable with age, to have found that the honourable
course of his own younger days, and the purity and excellence
of his precepts, had all been garnered up in the heart of his
grateful and most distinguished pupil. Nor could the evidence
of it be well made more striking than when heralded forth before
an audience composed of the most venerable and experienced, as
well as of the most rising members of the profession; and, to
crown the whole, with an eloquence at once modest and emotional,
impressive of the depth and sincerity with which the eulogium
was delivered.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine a scene more moving to the master,
more gratifying to the pupil, or more honourable to both. As
the style was very characteristic, we select a few passages. He
commences the lecture by saying, of Sir William Blizard, that
"he was my earliest instructor in anatomy and surgery, and I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
greatly indebted to him for much valuable information. My
warmest thanks are also due to him for the <i>interest he excited
in my mind towards these studies</i>, and for his excellent advice.
'Let your search after truth,' he would say, 'be eager and constant.
Be wary in admitting propositions to be facts, before
you have submitted them to the strictest examination. If, after
this, you believe them to be true, never disregard or forget <i>any
one</i> of them, however unimportant it may at the time appear.
Should you perceive truths to be important, make them motives
of action. Let them serve as springs to your conduct. If we
<i>neglect to draw such inferences</i>, or to act in conformity with
them, we fail in essential duties!'" Again, in remarking how
Sir William excited his enthusiasm by the <i>beau-idéal</i> which he
drew of the medical character, Mr. Abernethy observed: "I
cannot tell you how splendid and brilliant he made it appear;
and then he cautioned us <i>never</i> to tarnish its lustre by any
disingenuous conduct, or by anything that bore even the
<i>semblance</i> of dishonour." Abernethy, then proceeding in a
strain, warm, yet apologetic (Sir William being present), at length
concluded his public thanks to his venerable instructor, by
saying, "what I have now stated is a tribute due from me to
him; and I pay it on the present occasion in the <i>hope</i> that the
same precepts and motives may have the same effects on the
junior part of my audience as they were accustomed, in general,
to have on the pupils of Sir William Blizard."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>Abernethy then proceeded to advocate similar lofty views of
the nature and duties of our profession in the following manner:
"That which most dignifies man, is the cultivation of those
qualities which most distinguish him from the brute creation.
We should indeed seek truth for its importance, and act as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
dictates of reason direct us. By exercising our minds in the
attainment of medical knowledge, we may improve a science of
great public utility. We have need of enthusiasm, or of some
strong incentive, to induce us to spend our nights in study,
and our days in the disgusting and health-destroying duties of
the dissecting-room, or in that careful and distressing observation
of human diseases and infirmities which can alone enable
us to alleviate or remove them; some powerful inducement,"
he adds, "exclusive of fame or emolument (for, unfortunately,
a man may attain a considerable share of reputation and <i>practice,
without being a real student of his profession</i>). I place
before you the most animating incentive I know of&mdash;that is,
the enviable power of being extensively useful to your fellow-creatures.
You will be able to confer that which sick kings
would fondly purchase with their diadems, which wealth cannot
command, nor state nor rank bestow:&mdash;to alleviate or remove
disease, the most insupportable of human afflictions; and
thereby give health, the most invaluable of human blessings."</p>

<p>When Abernethy entered the London Hospital, he soon gave
proofs that Sir William's lessons were not unfruitful. He was
early employed to prepare the subject for lecture. Anatomy is
usually taught by combining three plans.</p>

<p>In one, the various structures&mdash;muscles, vessels, nerves, &amp;c.&mdash;are
exposed, by the removal of their covering and connecting-tissues,
and so displayed as to be clear and distinct. This is
"dissecting for lecture;" and it is the duty of the lecturer to
describe the connections and immediate uses of the parts so
displayed.</p>

<p>The body is then laid on a clean table, covered with a white
cloth, and everything is ready. There is some difference in these
matters in different hands; but attention to order and cleanliness
goes a long way in facilitating anatomical pursuits. To many
there may be much that is disagreeable in anatomy; but we are
persuaded that a coarse and vulgar inattention to decency has
often alone rendered it disgusting or repulsive.</p>

<p>The other plan is not materially different from the foregoing,
excepting that it is generally done by the anatomical assistant&mdash;technically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the "demonstrator." The parts, having been somewhat
exposed, are left, as much as is consistent with clearness, in
their natural and <i>relative</i> positions; and the vessels, nerves,
muscles, &amp;c. which have been for the most part described <i>separately</i>
by the lecturer, are now "demonstrated" (as the phrase is)
<i>together</i>. The relative positions of all parts are thus more
especially impressed on the student. In these "demonstrations"
there is the same attention to covering the body with a cloth, &amp;c.
as in the lecture.</p>

<p>Lastly, the pupil is required to make out the parts by dissecting
them himself, with such occasional assistance as may be at
first necessary, and which is given by the demonstrator, who
attends in the room for that purpose.</p>

<p>Now these duties (the lecture only excepted) were early performed
by Abernethy. We may safely infer from this, that he
was distinguished by his industry and zeal in the pursuit of knowledge,
and that he began thus early to cultivate that power of
communicating what he knew to others; in the exercise of which
he ultimately acquired a success, a <i>curiosa felicitas</i>, in which he
excelled all his contemporaries. That special qualifications were
already discernible, we may infer from the post he occupied being
invariably filled by a pupil of the hospital to which the school
belongs; whereas Mr. Abernethy was an apprentice of a surgeon
of St. Bartholomew's. On the testimony of a contemporary and
fellow-student, Mr. W. W. Cox, late of Wolverhampton, we learn
that he began to individualize himself very early. That, at the
London Hospital, "he was for the most part reserved, seldom
associating with any of the other students, but sitting in some
place or corner by himself, diligently intent on the business of
the lecture." Sir William Blizard is known to have felt proud
of him, and to have soon indulged in great expectations from his
character and talents.</p>

<p>I have already observed that Abernethy had the advantage of
attending also the Surgical Lectures of Mr. Pott, at St. Bartholomew's.
Mr. Pott was a gentleman, a scholar, and a good
writer, and seems to have been a spirited and attractive lecturer.
In an oration delivered by Sir William Blizard, in 1815, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
said that "it was difficult to give an idea of the elegance of his
language, the animation of his manner, or the perceptive force
or effect of his truths and his doctrines"&mdash;a character which is
by no means inconsistent with Mr. Pott's more sustained compositions.</p>

<p>Such opportunities were not lost on Abernethy. He soon
became possessed of what was known in the ordinary business of
anatomy and surgery. His diligence too had afforded him an
opportunity of testing those powers of communicating what he
knew, to which I have just alluded. As an apprentice of a surgeon
of Bartholomew's, his views were directed to that hospital;
and it was not long before the resignation of Mr. Pott, and the
appointment of Sir Charles Blicke, who was assistant surgeon, to
succeed him, opened to Abernethy an arena in which he might
further mature his peculiar aptitude for <i>teaching</i> his profession.
This had been, as we learn from his own testimony, an early
object of his ambition, and one for which he had already begun
to educate himself at the London Hospital.</p>


<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14">[14]</a> Sir William was a good surgeon and an excellent man. He was born at
Barnes, in Surrey, and practised his profession until his death, which took
place at the advanced age of ninety-three. One of his eyes was affected with

enthusiastically fond of his profession, and was chiefly remarkable for his
zealous observance of its honourable practice, and his indifference to lucre. He

<p>A large London Hospital is (if we may be excused the
Hibernianism, as Mr. Abernethy used to call it) a large microcosm.
There is little in human nature, of which an observant
eye may not here find types or realities. Hopes and fears, joys
and sorrows, solace and suffering, are here strangely intermingled.
General benevolence, with special exceptions. There is no human
good without its shadow of evil; even the benevolent must
take care. Impatient sensibility is much nearer a heartless indifference
than people generally imagine. The rose, Charity,
must take care of the nettle, Temper. The man who is chary or
chafed, in yielding that sympathy which philosophy and feeling
require, must beware lest he degenerate into a brute.</p>

<p>One of the brightest points in Abernethy's character, was,
that, however he might sometimes forget the courtesy due to his
private patients, he was never unkind to those whom charity had
confided to his care. One morning, leaving home for the hospital,
when some one was desirous of detaining him, he said:
"Private patients, if they do not like me, can go elsewhere; but
the poor devils in the hospital I am bound to take care of."</p>

<p>But to the hospital. Here we find some that have had the
best this world can give&mdash;some who have known little but misery:
the many no doubt lie between; but all come upon the same
errand. Disease is a great leveller. There all flock, as to Addison's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Mountain of Miseries, to get rid of their respective burthens,
or to effect such exchanges as benevolence may have to
offer, or the grave can alone supply. Our large hospitals have a
most efficient "<i>matériel</i>;" the accommodations are extensive,
the revenues princely. St. Bartholomew's, for example, has a
revenue of between twenty and thirty thousand pounds a year,
and is capable of receiving six hundred patients.</p>

<p>As regards what is mechanically or physically necessary to
the comfort of the inmates, the ample appliances of our large
hospitals leave little or nothing to be desired. There is every
facility for the execution of the duties, that convenient space
and orderly arrangement can suggest; in short, everything, in
the general sense of the word, that money can procure. Then
there are governors, whose hearts are as open as their purses,
whose names are recorded in gold letters, as the more recent or
current contributors to the funds of the establishment, and who
rejoice in the occasional Saturnalia of venison and turtle; all
duties or customs which may be observed, with the gratifying
reflection that they are taking the thorns out of the feet of the
afflicted; provided only that they do not involve forgetfulness of
other duties, the neglect of which may plant a few in their own.
The governors determine the election of the medical men, to
whom the welfare of the patients and the interests of science are
to be entrusted.</p>

<p>We have said that money cannot procure all things, and one
of these is mind&mdash;a remark requiring some qualification certainly;
but this we must refer to a subsequent chapter. Minds such as
Abernethy's are not to be found every day; and, notwithstanding
the sumptuous bill of fare we have already glanced at, there are
many things in a large London Hospital yet to be desired&mdash;defects
which, though it need no great penetration to discover, may,
for aught we know, require public attention, a <i>Government altogether
better informed</i> as to the actual defects in medical science,
and the plastic hand of power, to supply.</p>

<p>Abernethy was elected assistant surgeon of St. Bartholomew's
Hospital, July 15th, 1787. Sir Charles Blicke, an assistant surgeon,
had been appointed to the surgeoncy vacant by the resignation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
of Mr. Pott, and Abernethy succeeded to the assistant surgeoncy
thus vacated. The election was contested by two or three
other candidates; amongst the rest, by Mr. Heaviside. This
gentleman was an eminent surgeon, and a gentlemanly, facetious,
and agreeable companion. He was originally in the Guards, and
practised in London many years with great credit and respectability.
He was fond of science, and expended considerable sums
in the formation of an interesting museum. In the earlier part
of his life, he gave conversaziones, which were attended by great
numbers both of the scientific and fashionable.</p>

<p>He lived in a day when, if a gentleman felt himself insulted,
he had at least the satisfaction of being relieved from his sensibility
by having his brains blown out in a duel&mdash;professionally
speaking, by a kind of "operative surgery;" viz. the demolition
of the organ in which the troublesome faculty resided. Mr.
Heaviside, in his professional capacity, is said to have attended
more duels than any other surgeon of his time. This gentleman,
albeit not unused to one kind of contest, retired from that at the
hospital; which then lay between Mr. Jones and Mr. Abernethy&mdash;the
former polling twenty-nine, the latter fifty-three votes.</p>

<p>This was an important epoch in the life of Abernethy. It is
difficult to adjust the influence which it ultimately exerted, for
good or evil, on his future prospects and happiness, or on his relations
to science. The hospital had thus secured a man of extraordinary
talent, it is true, and in spite of a system which indefinitely
narrows the field of choice; but then the same "system"
(which we shall by and by describe) kept Abernethy, as regards the
hospital, for no less a term than twenty-eight years, in a position
which, although it did not exclude him altogether from the field
of observation it afforded, did much to restrict his cultivation of
it. His talents for observation, nevertheless, and the estimation
in which he was soon held, no doubt enabled him, to a certain
extent, to bring many of his views to the test of practice. Still,
as an assistant surgeon, except in the absence of his chief, he had
officially nothing to do; whatever cases he conducted, were only
by sufferance of his senior.</p>

<p>To a man of his ability, this was a false and miserably cramped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
position; one, in fact, much better calculated for detecting faults,
than for developing the best mode of amending them. As assistant
surgeon, he had no emolument from the hospital: he had,
therefore, a very reasonable inducement to set about doing that
for which he felt himself especially fitted, and to which he had
early directed his attention&mdash;namely, to teach his profession.
The event showed that he had by no means miscalculated his
powers. These proved well-nigh unrivalled. The appointment
to St. Bartholomew's, besides other advantages, gave him an opportunity
of lecturing with the <i>prestige</i> usually afforded by connection
with a large hospital. He did not, however, at first give
his lectures at the hospital, but delivered them in Bartholomew
Close.</p>

<p>There was at this time, in fact, no school, properly so called,
at St. Bartholomew's. Mr. Pott had been accustomed to give
about twenty-four lectures, which, as short practical discourses,
were first-rate for that period; but there were no other lectures,
not even on anatomy; which are essentially the basis of a medical
school.</p>

<p>Dr. Marshall, who was a very remarkable man, and no less
eminent for his general ability than for his professional acquirements,
was at this time giving anatomical lectures, at his house,
in Bartlett's Buildings, Holborn. In a biographical notice of
him, in the "Gentleman's Magazine," in which we read that he
was giving lectures about the year 1787, it is incidentally remarked,
that "in all probability he derived little support from
St. Bartholomew's Hospital; for that recently an ingenious
young gentleman, Mr. Abernethy, had begun to give lectures
in the neighbourhood."</p>

<p>Abernethy, who seems to have been always seeking information,
certainly attended some of Marshall's lectures; because he
would occasionally refer to anecdotes he had heard there. He
had thus listened to most of the best lecturers of his day&mdash;Sir
William Blizard, Dr. Maclaurin, Mr. Pott, and Dr. Marshall.
To the experience which he had thus acquired, and with the early
intention of applying it, he added a remarkable natural capacity
for communicating his ideas to others. We thus begin to perceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
his <i>early cultivation</i> of that aptitude for lecturing which no
doubt greatly contributed to the excellence which he ultimately
achieved in that mode of instruction.</p>

<p>We desire to impress this feature in his education, because
by and by it will, with other things, assist us in a rather difficult
task: that is, an attempt to analyze the means by which he obtained
such a power over his audience. He thus became a
teacher at the age of twenty-three, at a large hospital where he
was about to commence a school, of which he would be at first
the sole support. This necessarily involved a fearful amount of
labour, for an organization, active and energetic, but by no means
of great physical power.</p>

<p>Labour, to be sure, is the stuff that life is made of; but then,
in a fine organization like Abernethy's, it should be directed with
economy of power, and in application to the highest purposes.
Such an organization should, if possible, have been relieved from
the drudgery which lies within the sphere of more ordinary capacity.
Ready as we are, then, to congratulate the young philosopher,
about to display his powers on a field where he was so
successful, still misgivings creep in which restrain, or at least
moderate, our enthusiasm. Unusual ability, no doubt, allows
men to anticipate the order which, as the rule, Nature seems to
have assigned to the pursuits of intellect; but we must not suffer
ourselves to be blinded to the rule, by the frequency of the exception.
Youth is the time for <i>acquiring</i> knowledge; and,
although there is no reason why the fruits may not be imparted
to others as fast as they are gathered, still, when the larger space
of a man's time at twenty-three is devoted to <i>teaching</i> merely, it
may reasonably be doubted whether it be such a disposition of it
as is best calculated to economise his power, or develop the maximum
of its influence, in <i>extending</i> the science to which it is
devoted.</p>

<p>John Hunter declined undertaking to teach anatomy at forty
(1768), because it would have "<i>engaged his attention too much</i>
to admit of that general attention to his profession; to forming
habits and established modes of thinking, which he thought
necessary." In Abernethy's after life, we think we saw a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
deal of the wear and tear that early and diversified labour had
impressed on his physical organization. In advancing life, the
natural desire for ease, if not carefully guarded, may not be without
its perils; but precocious labour, stinted rest, and the malaria
of large cities, crowded hospitals, and filthy dissecting rooms, too
certainly bring on a train of evils, not less grave because more
distant.</p>

<p>We shall have to revert to these points when, in conclusion,
we consider the variety and importance of his contributions to
the science of his profession, and why they were not still more
numerous. The latter, though perhaps the less grateful, is by no
means the least useful portion of biographical analysis.</p>

<p>Commencing his lectures in Bartholomew Close, they soon
seem to have attracted notice. The anatomical courses, which
were always on a similar plan, were very skilfully framed to interest
and instruct the students. The arrangement of the matter
was such, that the dry details of anatomy were lighted up by a
description, not only of the purposes served by the various parts,
but by as much as could be conveniently included of the diseases
or accidents to which they were subject; and thus the juxtaposition
of the structure, function, and diseases, naturally tended
to impress the whole.</p>

<p>Diseases of more general site, and which therefore did not fall
conveniently under discussion in describing any one part, were
reserved for a separate course of lectures. It was in this course
that he more fully developed those general principles on which
his reputation more especially rests. Of his inimitable manner
we shall speak hereafter.</p>

<p>He was one of the first who insisted on the great importance
of Comparative Anatomy, in studying the uses of the several
parts of the human body. Were it not for the comparison of the
relations of various parts in different animals, we should be continually
the victims of hypotheses, which the juxtaposition or
other characters of organs in any <i>one</i> animal are constantly suggesting.
Here necessity compels the observance of that rule of
inductive philosophy, which seeks not for the true relation of any
one thing in <i>itself</i>, but from <i>universals</i>, from uses and application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
which are common to <i>other</i> things. In one case nature makes
that luminously clear, which is only dimly shadowed forth in
another; and in seeing organs under every conceivable variety of
circumstance, we learn to estimate at their full value characteristics
which are common to and inseparable from all&mdash;the only point
whence we can securely deduce their real uses in the animal economy.
Of this, Abernethy early saw and inculcated the advantages.</p>

<p>As it was impossible to combine anything like a comprehensive
study of a vast science in the same course with lectures on
human Anatomy, he was accustomed, at the conclusion of the
course, to devote a lecture or two to select illustrations of this
important subject. This he ultimately relinquished, the universal
admission of the fact rendering it no longer necessary.</p>

<p>We shall have occasion, by and by, to record the circumstances
under which one of the most important steps was taken
for securing the interests of Comparative Anatomy in this country&mdash;a
proceeding in a great degree owing to the good sense and
personal influence of Abernethy, and exemplifying, in the admirable
fitness of the individual<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor"><sup>16</sup></a>, the penetrative perception of character
which distinguished his early Preceptor in Anatomy.</p>

<p>We have little doubt that we have now entered on the most
laborious part of Abernethy's life, and that, during this and some
succeeding years, his exertions were so great and unremitting, as
to have laid the foundation of those ailments which, at a comparatively
early period of life, began to embitter its enjoyment, and
to strew the onward path with the elements of decay and suffering.</p>

<p>He lectured himself on anatomy, physiology, and pathology,
besides surgery&mdash;subjects which are now usually divided between
three or four teachers. There is abundant evidence that he was
an attentive observer of what was going on in the hospital. He
was assiduous in visiting most places where any information was
to be obtained. We find him attending Mr. Hunter's lectures,
and constantly meditating on what he heard there; thus seeking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
opportunities of making himself more and more familiar with
those opinions which, in his view, on most of the points to <i>which</i>
they related, <i>were</i> definite&mdash;cautiously deduced&mdash;not always clear,
perhaps; but, when understood, truthful.</p>

<p>He endeavoured further to mature an accurate perception of
Mr. Hunter's views, by seeking private conferences with him;
and Hunter kindly afforded him facilities for so doing. We have
Abernethy's own acknowledgment of this, coupled with his regret
that he could not more frequently avail himself of them. Indeed,
when we consider that Abernethy lived at this time in St. Mary
Axe, or in Mildred's Court in the Poultry,&mdash;that he was lecturing
on the sciences I have mentioned,&mdash;that he was observant of cases
at the hospital (a very timeful occupation),&mdash;and consider the
distance between these points and Mr. Hunter's residence in
Leicester Square, or his school in Windmill Street,&mdash;we see there
could not be much time to spare. It was not, however, merely
during the time at which he was delivering his lectures that he
was thus actively employed. We have, not unfrequently, evidence
that he was often at the hospital late in the day, in the most
leisure season of the year, when perhaps his senior had, during
his absence in the summer, confided the patients to his care.</p>

<p>We used to get, occasionally, such passages as these in the
lectures: "One summer evening, as I was crossing the Square of
the hospital, a student came running to me," &amp;c. Very significant
of continued attention during the summer or leisure
season&mdash;he not being, be it remembered, other than an assistant-surgeon,
and not, therefore, necessarily having duties at the
hospital.</p>

<p>At this period, it was a common practice with him to rise as
early as four in the morning. He would sometimes go away into
the country, that he might read, more free from interruption.
He also instituted various experiments, some of which we shall
have shortly to notice, for the philosophical spirit in which they
were conducted. His visit to France must have been made about
this time, when the celebrated Desault was at the height of his
reputation. His stay could not have been long, in all probability;
but we have evidence showing how quickly he perceived, amidst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
the success of Desault, the more important defects of the
hospital&mdash;the Hôtel Dieu&mdash;to which he was <i>chirurgien-en-chef</i>,
and the influence exerted by them on his practice.</p>

<p>As we shall be obliged again to mention Desault in connection
with a material item in the catalogue of our obligations to Abernethy,
we postpone for the present any further remarks on that
distinguished French surgeon.</p>

<p>Abernethy now continued actively engaged in the study and
teaching of his profession. The most remarkable circumstance
at this time of his life, and for several years, was his peculiar
diffidence&mdash;an unconquerable shyness, a difficulty in commanding
at pleasure that self-possession which was necessary to open his
lecture. Everything connected with his lectures is of importance
to those who may be engaged in this mode of teaching, or
who may desire to excel in it. No man ever attained to excellence
more varied or attractive; yet many years elapsed before he
had overcome the difficulty to which I have alluded.</p>

<p>An old student, who attended his lectures, not earlier than
1795, told me that he recollected several occasions on which,
before beginning the lecture, he had left the theatre for a time, to
collect himself sufficiently to begin his discourse. On these
occasions, a tumult of applause seemed only to increase the difficulty.
The lecture once commenced, I have no evidence of his
having exhibited further embarrassment. He seems early to have
attained that happy manner which, though no doubt greatly
aided by his peculiar and in some sense dramatic talent, there
is every reason to believe had been carefully cultivated by study
and observation.</p>

<p>His lectures continuing to attract a larger and larger class,
the accommodation became inadequate for the increased number
of students. The governors of St. Bartholomew's, therefore, in
1790, determined on building a regular theatre within the
hospital. It was completed in 1791, and Abernethy gave his
October courses of anatomy, physiology, and surgery of that
year in the new theatre. He had thus become the founder of the
School of St. Bartholomew's, which, for the approaches it made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
towards giving a more scientific phase to the practice of Surgery,
was certainly superior to any other.</p>

<p>In expressing this opinion, we except, of course, John Hunter's
lectures, for the short time that they were contemporaneous
with those of Mr. Abernethy; John Hunter dying, as we have
said, in 1793. As St. Bartholomew's Hospital was our own
Alma Mater, we may, perhaps, speak with a fallible partiality; but
we think not. We are far from being blind to the faults which
Bartholomew's has, in common with other schools; and, we believe,
regret as much as anybody can do, that the arrangements
of our hospitals, excellent as in many respects they are, should
still so defectively supply many of the requisitions which the
interests of science demand. Some of these defects we may
endeavour to point out in their proper place. We shall now leave
the subject of Mr. Abernethy and his lectures, and begin to consider
some of his earlier efforts at authorship, sketch the objects
he had in view, and the mode of investigation.</p>

<p>The most universal character impressed on all created things
that sense allows us to recognize, or philosophical inquiry to demonstrate,
is "change."</p>

<p>While nothing is more certain, few things pass less observed;
or, when first announced, more stagger conviction.</p>

<p>An old man sees the yew-tree of his boyish days apparently
the same. Gilpin tells us "eight hundred years is no great age
for an oak<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor"><sup>17</sup></a>!"</p>

<p>The cliff which we left "beetling" seems to beetle still;
mountains appear to be everlasting; yet, were seas and rivers to
disclose even a small part of their mission, the Danube or the Volga
might tell of millions of tons of soil carried from higher levels to
the Black Sea and the Caspian. Animals, too, are mighty agents
in recording the mutability of the matter of the universe. Coral
Reefs, never spoken of in smaller terms than miles and fathoms,
are the vast ocean structures of countless millions of animalcules,
which serve, as it were, to link together the two great kingdoms of
organic nature&mdash;the animal and vegetable creation. The microscopic
geologist informs us of whole strata, well-nigh entirely composed
of the silicified skeletons of insects. Sir Charles Lyell
further impresses on us the reality of continual change, by referring
(and, as it would appear, with increasing probability) even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
the stupendous changes demonstrated by geology to the agency
of causes still in operation.</p>

<p>Animals, however, besides the curious structures which they
combine to contribute, are individually undergoing constant
change. Man is not only no exception, but he is a "glaring"
example.</p>

<p>The whole human race are in hourly progress of mutation.
"In the midst of life we are in death," is a truth to which physiology
yields its tribute of illustration. Every moment we are
having the old particles of our bodies silently taken away, and
new materials as silently laid down. Surrounding influences,
as air, moisture, temperature, &amp;c. which, during life, are necessary
to existence&mdash;the moment the breath leaves us, proceed to
resolve the body into the elements of which it was composed. In
all cases, change may be regarded as the combined result of two
forces: the force acting, and the body acted on&mdash;that is to say,
of certain external agents and certain forces inherent in the thing
changed.</p>

<p>Animals are no exceptions to this view, and diseases are
amongst a multitude of other exemplifications of it; but, in
order to distinguish these more clearly, it is desirable that we
should be familiar with those more ordinary changes in the body
which are constantly going on; and to some of these were
Abernethy's early investigations directed.</p>

<p>In proceeding to give some account of his works, we must
be necessarily more brief than a scientific analysis would require.</p>

<p>To do him full justice, it would be necessary to republish his
writings, with appropriate commentaries. We shall hope, however,
to do enough to relieve his memory from some of the
numerous misconceptions of his principles and opinions; and to
endeavour to show his claims to the respect and gratitude of
posterity.</p>

<p>In everything Abernethy did, we find evidence of the acuteness
of his mind, and his general qualifications for philosophical
research.</p>

<p>His lectures had gradually attracted an increasing number of
students; and he seems, about 1791, to have been desirous of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
prefacing his lectures on Anatomy by discussing the general
composition of Animal Matter.</p>

<p>The rapid advance of chemistry had given a great impetus to
this kind of investigation. Abernethy was not only well up in
the chemistry of the day, but also not unskilled in the manipulatory
application of it; and he felt interested in observing the great
diversity of substances which appeared to be made up of similar
elements. Boyle has recorded a vast number of facts, many of
which would even now well repay a thoughtful revision; and
Fordyce was certainly one of our most philosophical physicians.</p>

<p>Boyle had grown vegetables in water and air only, and found
they produced woody fibre. Fordyce found that gold fish, placed
under similar conditions, not only lived, but <i>grew</i>. Abernethy's
experiments had for their object to inquire how far organized
bodies (animals and vegetables) were capable of deriving their
various structures from similar simple elements.</p>

<p>He grew vegetables on flannel, wetted from time to time with
distilled water; and then, analyzing them, compared the results
with those of the analysis of vegetables grown in the ordinary
manner.</p>

<p>Other curious experiments consisted in pouring concentrated
acids on vegetable structures, with a view to dissolve any alkali
or iron which they might contain, and then analyzing the vegetables
so treated.</p>

<p>He now found, in the burnt vegetable, lime, iron, &amp;c. which,
had they been free to combine, should have been taken up by the
acid to which he had subjected the vegetable before he analyzed
it; but he found neither in the <i>acid</i>, whilst both were discovered
in the <i>vegetables</i>.</p>

<p>He also inquired whether tadpoles and leeches would live
when kept only in distilled water, with the admission of air. For
example, he placed twelve leeches in two gallons of distilled
water, They weighed, in all, twelve scruples. In three months,
two had died, but the remaining ten weighed twelve scruples,
showing that they had <i>grown</i>. He next inquired whether vegetables,
grown in air and distilled water, would admit of further
conversion into the structure of animals; and, for this purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
he fed rabbits on vegetables so reared. His rabbits appear to
have eaten about six plates at a meal of young cabbages thus
reared on flannel wetted with distilled water.</p>

<p>He also experimented on eggs, both before and at the time
of incubation.</p>

<p>He wished to ascertain the quantity of lime in the chicken
and the egg, respectively; and whether any of the lime was absorbed
from the shell, which it appeared not to be.</p>

<p>It is curious to observe the time and labour he gave to these
experiments; they evince a very perfect knowledge of the chemistry
necessary; whilst the circumstances calculated to interfere
with or obscure the conclusions from them are judiciously and
clearly stated.</p>

<p>Many of his remarks, as well as the ingenious suggestions
with which they are interspersed, exemplify the caution with
which he reasoned. In speaking of his experiments on leeches
and tadpoles, many of which latter had become perfectly developed
frogs, he says: "The experiments which I made on this
plan (in vessels of distilled water, covered with linen) were
made in the summer, when to prevent vegetation was impossible;
and, on the other hand, when the vessels were covered
over, even leeches died. In the winter, vegetation might cease;
but then the torpid state of the animals would render the
experiments inconclusive."</p>

<p>He reduced an equal number of eggs and chickens (at the
time of incubation) to ashes; sometimes in crucibles, sometimes
in retorts. On the ashes he poured some distilled water, and
ascertained the salts (as lime, &amp;c.) contained in them. In some
experiments, the quantity of these found in the ashes of the
chickens greatly exceeded that found in the ashes of the eggs.
In other experiments, the quantities were equal.</p>

<p>In some of his experiments, after using the best chemical
tests for detecting iron, lime, and the salts, and then washing
the residue with distilled water, he burnt it in a crucible, and
found more lime and iron; on which he makes the following
remarks, which suggest what we apprehend, even at this time, is
a very necessary caution:</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p>"This circumstance proves to me that the substances found
in the ashes of burnt animal matter do not formally exist in the
mass before its destruction, but are only new distributions of
the same ultimate particles which, under their former mode of
arrangement, made the animal substance; but which, being
driven asunder by the repulsive power of fire, are left at
liberty to form other modifications of matter." Page 97.
Just what happens when animal matter is burned, in the formation
of ammonia, by the union of the nitrogen and hydrogen
then set free.</p>

<p>He investigated, also, the question of how far the results of
the decomposition of animal matter would be identical, if the
analyses were conducted by heat, or by putrefactive decomposition.
In this experiment, he selected blood; and he found that
blood which had been allowed to putrify yielded <i>a much larger
quantity</i> of iron and lime.</p>

<p>The whole of the experiments are very suggestive, and full
of thought; and not only indicate very forward views of the
elementary constitution of organic and inorganic matter, but also
moot questions which have not lost any of their interest by the
most recent investigations. He concludes by observing that he
had undertaken these experiments for the reasons already assigned,
and because he had imbibed the idea that the <i>ultimate particles
of matter were the same</i>.</p>

<p>He remarks that the progress of chemistry had not been
applied, in every respect, to the best purpose; that men's views
were becoming <i>contracted</i> by being directed to <i>individual</i> objects;
and that they had ceased to contemplate the beautiful and extensive
subject of matter and its combinations; and he complains
that even Fourcroi, Lavoisier, and Chaptal, either avoid
the subject, or do not sufficiently consider it. We must recollect
this was said before Sir H. Davy had made his splendid discoveries.
Abernethy, after observing that he hopes his experiments
will induce others to investigate the subject, concludes
thus:</p>

<p>"I know not any thought that, on contemplation, can so
delight the mind with admiration of the simplicity and power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
evident in the operations of the Creator, as the consideration
that, by different arrangement and motion of singular atoms,
He has produced that variety of substances found in the world,
and which are so conducive to the wants and gratification of
the creatures who inhabit it."</p>

<p>Amongst a multitude of examples, which teach us how little
we can infer the importance of anything in nature from its size,
or other impressions which it may convey to mere sense, we
might adduce the wonderful little tubes, certain relations of
which were the objects of this paper. Those constant mutations
in animal bodies which are every moment in progress, are, in
great part, due to a very curious order of vessels, of such extreme
minuteness and tenuity, that, being in the dead animal usually
empty and transparent, they are very commonly invisible, and
thus long eluded discovery. There is one situation, however, in
which circumstances combine to expose them to observation.
Transparent though they be, they are here usually rendered visible;
first, by being loaded with a milk-like fluid; and secondly,
by being placed between the folds of a membrane, itself beautifully
transparent (the mesentery). This fluid they have just
taken up from the digestive surfaces on which their mouths open,
and they are now carrying it off to pour it into the blood-vessels,
that it may be added to the general stock of the circulation.</p>

<p>In the situation above mentioned they were at length discovered,
about the commencement of the 17th century. Every thing destined
to support the body with new material, as well as the old, which
is to be taken away, must first be sucked up by the myriads of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
inconceivably minute mouths of these vessels, which, from their
office, are called the <i>absorbents</i>. These absorbents may therefore be
regarded as the sentinels of the body. They are very sensitive
and excitable; but, besides this, there are placed in the course of
their journey, from the surfaces whence they bring their contents,
and the blood-vessels to which they are carrying them, a number
of <i>douaniers</i>, or custom-house officers (the glands, or kernels, as
they are popularly called), whereby, as we have every reason to
believe, the fluids they are importing are subjected to rigid examination;
and, if found to be injurious, to some modification,
tending to render them more fit for admission into the system.</p>

<p>If the contents are very irritating, these vigilant guards&mdash;these
kernels&mdash;become very painfully affected, and sometimes
inflammation is set up, sufficient even to destroy the part; as if,
faithful to their trust, they perished themselves, rather than give
entrance to anything injurious to the body.</p>

<p>We should never advance, however, in our story, if we were
to tell all the interesting peculiarities of these curious vessels.</p>

<p>When first discovered, and the office assigned to them could
no longer be disputed, the general distribution of them was still
doubted. As it was usual to render them visible by filling them
with quicksilver, so, with a kind of reasoning which has too often
characterized mere anatomical research, when they could not be
made visible, it became the fashion to doubt their existence.
Amongst other structures, Bone was formerly one in regard to
which people found a difficulty. How could such delicate vessels
exist in such an apparently dense structure? But Mr. Abernethy,
who, like Bacon, had always opposed mere eye-reasoning, used to
observe, with equal simplicity and good sense, that, for his part,
he could see no more difficulty in an absorbent taking up a particle
of bone, than he could in comprehending how a vessel could
lay it down, which nobody doubted. We now know that bone is
not only supplied with all the vessels which characterize a living
structure, but so liberally, that, in comparison with some other
structures of the body, we regard it as a part of high organization.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the extreme minuteness and transparency of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
these absorbent vessels naturally led persons to regard with considerable
interest any magnified view of them, such as that
afforded by larger animals. In the paper before us, which was
published in the "Philosophical Transactions" for 1793, Mr.
Abernethy gives the account of his examination of the absorbents
in a whale; and his object was to help to determine a question
long agitated, whether the glands or kernels were composed of
cells, or whether they were merely multiplied convolutions of
vessels. He selected the absorbents from the situation to which
I have already referred. He threw into the arteries which carry
blood to nourish the gland, a red solution containing wax, which
of course became solid on cooling; and into the veins which return
the blood from all parts, a similar solution, only coloured
yellow. He filled the absorbents with quicksilver.</p>

<p>He found, in filling the absorbents, that wherever the quicksilver
arrived at a gland, there was a hesitation&mdash;its course became
retarded, and that this retardation was longest at those
glands which were <i>nearest the source</i> whence the vessels had
drawn their contents, viz. the alimentary canal: as if the surfaces
over which the fluid had to pass were more multiplied where
most <i>necessary</i>, or, recurring to our metaphor, as if the more
strict <i>douanier</i> had been placed on the frontier. He says that he
found that some of the absorbents went <i>over</i> the glands, whilst
others <i>penetrated</i> these bodies. That he found that the melted
wax which he had thrown into the vessels had formed round
nodules of various sizes. He then extended his examination of
these vessels to those of horses and other large animals; and the
result of his investigation was, that it inclined him to the conclusion
that the glands were <i>not merely</i> made up of convolutions
of vessels, but were of <i>a really cellular structure</i>.</p>

<p>The paper is very modestly put forth, and he concludes it by
observing that he offers it merely for the facts which it contains,
and not as justifying any <i>final</i> conclusion; but "as all our
knowledge of the absorbents," he continues, "seems to have
been acquired by fragments, I am anxious to add my mite to
our general stock of information on the subject."</p>

<p>It may not be uninteresting to some unprofessional readers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
to know that the glands here alluded to are the organs which are
so seriously diseased in those lamentable conditions popularly
expressed, I believe, by the term mesenteric disease, or disease of
the mesentery.</p>

<p>However paradoxical it may appear, it is not the less true,
that nothing more teachingly impresses the inquirer into nature
with the <i>actual</i> presence of general laws than the <i>apparent</i> exceptions
to them. Finite capacities in dealing with the Infinite
must of course encounter multitudes of facts, the meaning of
which they cannot interpret&mdash;portions of the Divine Government,
as Butler has said, which they do not as yet understand.</p>

<p>In philosophical investigations, these are properly regarded as
facts which, in the present state of knowledge, cannot be made to

<p>At one period, departures from the ordinary structure or form
in animals were simply regarded as unintelligible abstractions,
and no more philosophical expression was given to them than
"Lusus Naturæ"&mdash;sports of Nature. Progressive science, however,
has thrown considerable light on such phenomena, and
invested many of them with a new interest.</p>

<p>Physiologists have not arrived at the explanation of all such
facts; but much has been done by comparative anatomy to show
that many of them are merely arrests of development, and cases
of interference with the ordinary law.</p>

<p>That, in fact, they show the mutual harmony and connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
of the laws of nature to be such, that the development of any
one law implies the concurrence, so to speak, of some other, just
as the successful incubation of an egg, or any other familiar fact,
implies the presence of certain conditions. We cannot boil a
drop of water without the concurrence of various laws: we say
it boils ordinarily at 212° of Fahrenheit; but how many conditions
this involves!</p>

<p>Until understood, how few could have guessed that mechanical
pressure could have so modified the degree of heat necessary, as
to exalt it to more than double, or reduce it to less than half;
and again, how few would have looked for the force which, under
common circumstances, governed the point at which water was
thus converted into steam, in the pressure of the atmosphere;
yet so mutually influential are these conditions&mdash;namely, heat
and a certain pressure in modifying this change of form or matter&mdash;that
some of Faraday's most interesting results in experimental
chemistry (we allude to his reducing several gaseous bodies to
the liquid form) were obtained by <i>abstracting</i> heat and increasing
pressure.</p>

<p>It is of very great consequence to remember these interferences
in relation to disease, because most diseases may be regarded
as examples of them. Considered as "abstract wholes,"
as entities&mdash;diseases are necessarily unintelligible: but when
looked at as natural processes obscured by interferences (if the
inquiry be conducted with strict observance of those principles
which are essential in all philosophical researches), they either at
once become intelligible, or, at least, as open to investigation as
any other facts in natural philosophy.</p>

<p>When we investigate the laws of nature with a view to the
development of the sublime objects of natural theology, the concurrence
of the various conditions, necessary to the most ordinary
phenomenon, inclose the most irresistible proofs, from natural
evidence, of the Unity of the Creator.</p>

<p>Regarded in the light of facts which we as yet may not be
able to generalise, the cases here recorded by Abernethy are very
interesting; although it is to be regretted that both cases were
bodies brought in for dissection, in times when the circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
baffled, if they did not forbid, any inquiry into the histories of
them. It is lamentable to think of the state of the law with
respect to Anatomy at that time.</p>

<p>Any surgeon who was convicted of <i>mala praxis</i>, resulting
from ignorance of Anatomy, was severely fined, perhaps ruined;
and yet so entirely unprovided were the profession with any
<i>legitimate</i> means of studying Anatomy, that they could only be
obtained by a connivance at practices the most demoralizing and
revolting.</p>

<p>Bodies were, in fact, chiefly obtained by the nightly maraudings
of a set of men, who, uninfluenced alike by the repulsions
of instinct or the terrors of law, made their living by the plunder
of grave-yards.</p>

<p>Many a tale of horror, no doubt, might be told on this
subject.</p>

<p>Graves were very commonly watched; and severe nocturnal
conflicts occurred, which were conducted in a deadly spirit, not
difficult to imagine. We believe all this has passed away; there
is no necessity now for such revolting horrors. The public began
to <i>think</i> for themselves, the <i>real remedy</i> for abuses. But to our
cases. Both were curious; the one was the body of a boy, who
did not appear to have been imperfectly nourished, but in whom
the alimentary canal was found to be less than one-fourth of its
natural length, and in which also the relative length of its two
grand divisions was reversed. The smaller in diameter, usually
very much the longer, was so unnaturally short, as not to exceed
in length more than one half of the more capacious but normally
shorter division of the canal.</p>

<p>The other case presented a no less curious departure from the
ordinary arrangement of parts than a reversed position of the
heart; which, instead of being placed with its point as usual on
the left side, was found to have that part situated on the right.
In the natural condition of things, there is a difference on the
two sides of the body, in the manner in which the large vessels
are given off to supply the head and upper extremities. These
differences existed, but were reversed; the arrangement of vessels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
ordinarily found on the right, being here on the left side, and
<i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>In all this, there would be nothing to prevent the heart from
pumping the blood to all parts in the natural way. But another
very singular arrangement was found in relation to the liver. To
the unprofessional reader we should observe, that usually, whilst
all other things are made, or secreted as we term it, from the
purer or arterial blood; in the <i>human body</i>, the Bile is secreted
from a vein which enters the liver for that purpose.</p>

<p>Now, in the case before us, this great vein never entered the
liver at all; so that here the bile was separated, like other animal
fluids, by the arteries. The arteries going to the liver were found
much larger than usual.</p>

<p>Mr. Abernethy examined the bile by submitting it to various
tests; and comparing the results with those obtained from ordinary
bile, he found them to be the same. His remarks are, as
usual, ingenious and to the point, and very characteristic of the
penetrative perception with which he seized on the proximate and
practical relations of facts. "When we see the unusual circumstance,"
says he, "of secretion taking place from a <i>vein</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor"><sup>18</sup></a>, we
are apt to conclude that the properties of such a secretion require
that it should be made from venous blood. But, in this
case, we see that bile could be prepared from <i>arterial</i> blood;
and we are led, therefore, so far to modify our conclusion as to
infer, not that venous blood is <i>necessary</i>, but that it can be
made to answer the purpose."</p>

<p>We must not omit that these remarks are supported by comparative
anatomy. As we descend in the scale of creation from
the more complicated organizations to those which are more
simple in their structure or their relations, the arrangement which
I have stated as usual in man no longer obtains, but the bile is
secreted from the arteries as the other fluids of the animal&mdash;showing,
in fact, that the inference drawn by Abernethy was the legitimate
conclusion.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>Since the discovery of this case, one or two others have been
observed; and the opinions of several eminent men, in relation
to the bearing such cases have on the ordinary sources of bile,
are described in Mr. Kiernan's interesting paper on the Anatomy
and Physiology of the Liver, in the "Philosophical Transactions."
It is very interesting, particularly to a professional reader, to
peruse that discussion, in order to estimate Mr. Abernethy's comparatively
simple, ready, and, as it would seem, correct view of
the subject.</p>

<p>One other thing we learn from these cases&mdash;the extreme importance
of examining bodies whilst their histories and symptoms
can be recorded. It might have been highly useful to science,
had the histories of these cases been known; and the circumstance
should be mentioned, as, in some measure, tending to
counterbalance in the public that not unnatural but (as regards
their real interest) not less to be lamented aversion to the inspection
of the dead&mdash;a branch only, it is true, but a very important
one of physiological inquiry. It is the only means of
which we can have the comfort of knowing that, however unable
we may have been to arrest disease, we were at least right in the
seat we had assigned to it; but it is infinitely more valuable in
disclosing to us affections of organs which <i>had given no sign</i>, and
in thus impressing on us the necessity of taking a wider range in
our investigations, and comprehending in them all <i>those injurious
influences</i> which have, <i>at various periods</i>, acted on the body; for
we <i>thus</i> obtain an insight into the nature of disease which <i>no mere
present symptoms</i> can ever afford us.</p>

<p>The repulsions which the public have to overcome are admitted;
but let us not, in common justice, forget those sacrifices
of time, labour, and too often of health also, which are made by
the profession. Nor is it immaterial to mention that it is a
service for which they seldom receive any remuneration, the only
incentive being one which, if it excite no sympathy, is at least
entitled to respect&mdash;namely, the desire to improve their knowledge
of their profession. There is no doubt of the deep and common
interest which the public and the profession have in this question;
and it is from that conviction that I have ventured on these few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
remarks. Abernethy, when he introduced any subject in his
lectures, was accustomed to say at once all that he intended to
remark on it. I beg, in the foregoing observations, to follow his
example, which I trust the reader will accept as an apology for
the digression.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful poems in the English language,
perhaps, is Armstrong's "Art of Health." Whether it be that
the title is uninviting, or from some other cause, I know not, but
it is very little read; yet scarcely any one who has read it, has
done so without pleasure. Besides containing many admirable
and valuable instructions, it shows how an ordinary, and to many
even a repulsive, subject can be treated with such discretion,
taste, and even elegance, as to render it pleasing and attractive.</p>

<p>Such a writer could have conveyed, even in prose, explanations
of disease so as to interest and instruct his readers. With no
such power, we are almost inclined to regret the impossibility of
doing Abernethy justice, without saying something of nearly all
his works. If, however, in so doing, we make one more step
towards familiarizing the public with matters which affect their
best interests, we shall not regret any labour which this, the most
difficult part of our task, may have required.</p>

<p>We so usually connect pain with disease, that, in our haste,
we are apt to imagine that it is not merely the worst feature, but
the only sign of it. "I am very well, I am in no pain whatever,"
is a common expression, and yet a person may be irremediably
stricken, without suffering any pain. Pain is, in fact, often the
best possible monitor, and has saved many thousands of lives by
the necessity it has imposed of observing what is the best of all
remedies, in a large class of cases. Amongst hundreds of examples,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
we might cite several affections of joints, wherein pain
alone has sometimes exacted the observance of that which surgeons
were a long time before they had learned the full advantage of;
and which, when they had been taught it by Abernethy, they have
often failed, with all their endeavours, to accomplish, but which,
when efficiently secured, is of more consequence than any one
other remedy; we mean "<i>absolute repose</i>" There are plenty of
diseases marked by little or no pain, or which, at all events, are
not painful; but they are amongst the most fatal and insidious of
human maladies. Let us commence the record of some of the
numerous improvements we owe to the genius of Abernethy, by
mentioning one of them.</p>

<p>We have, too many of us probably, observed something like
the following, on the assembling of a family of a morning: the
usual greetings interchanged, and that cheerful meal, breakfast,
fairly begun, our attention has been directed to some fine, comely,
perhaps beautiful girl, who, to the hilarious spirits of her laughing
sisters, has only contributed a somewhat languid smile. We
may, perhaps, have remarked that she is a little more spoken to
by her mother than any other of the family circle; we may, too,
have observed a tone compounded of confidence and gentleness,
somewhat different from that addressed to her sisters. Still,
though less hilarious than the rest, she has chatted away with
considerable cheerfulness; she has, however, a languor in her
manner, which but for the surrounding contrast, might not have
occurred to us. On rising from the breakfast-table, we observe
that her gait is peculiar. She is not exactly lame; but her step
has something between firmness and faltering, that seems to indicate
more effort or less power.</p>

<p>Poor girl! she is about to have, if she have it not already, a
stealthy and hitherto almost painless disease; stealthy, because it
is so far a comparatively painless malady. Deep in the loins
there has been the smouldering fire of disease, which is to result
in what is called "Lumbar abscess." This grievous malady,
which in <i>many instances</i> begins not less insidiously than I have
mentioned, is found on inquiry not to have been <i>wholly</i> without
some of those premonitory signs which, in obedience to the beneficent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
laws of the animal economy, almost invariably precede
even the most insidious malady. Inquiry generally elicits that,
however little complained of, there has been at times more or less
of uneasiness, if not pain, felt in the loins; that it has not been
so much lately; but that it has become less in force or frequency,
since the appearance of some swelling, which may be in the loins,
or some other part, lower or more or less distant.</p>

<p>It is a malady very commonly connected with diseased spine,
but frequently without any such complication; and it is curious
that Mr. Abernethy at first met with as many as, I think, eight
cases in succession, which were not complicated with any disease
of the spine. Under any circumstances, it is a serious malady,
and usually, when the collection bursts, or is opened, severe constitutional
symptoms supervene, which, though not without exceptions,
gradually usher in what Armstrong calls</p>


<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"The slow minings of the hectic fire,"</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="in0">and destroy the patient.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Abernethy's plan was intended to prevent this last
and dreaded issue. The chief points of excellence in his recommendations
are&mdash;</p>

<p>First, the emphatic recognition of the constitutional origin
and nature of the malady;</p>

<p>Secondly, the consequent necessity of a greater attention to
the general health of the patient;</p>

<p>And lastly, if it could not be dispersed, to relieve the interior
of its contents, so that its extensive surface should never be
exposed.</p>

<p>The mode of proceeding was extremely simple, and there is
no doubt that a great many lives have been saved by the practice
thus recommended. I have heard, however, that some surgeons
think the merits of the plan overrated, which I can only suppose
explicable on the ground that it has been imperfectly followed
out; and I am the more disposed to this view, because nothing
can be more <i>entirely opposed</i> to Mr. Abernethy's principles and
intentions, than the treatment of many cases <i>said to have been
treated</i> after Mr. Abernethy's plan.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>As a considerable number of families have really a painful
interest in this question, I will, at the risk of being a little professional,
state what has occurred under my own observation, in
explanation of the apparent discrepancy. My own experience
obliges me to coincide with those authorities on this subject, who,
approving Mr. Abernethy's practice, adopted it. Amongst a host
of eminent men, I will mention only two, Sir Astley Cooper, and
a scarcely less eminent authority, Mr. Samuel Cooper, the laborious
and distinguished author of the "Surgical Dictionary," who
observes that Mr. Abernethy's plan deserves "infinite praise."
Sir Astley Cooper, too, in speaking of a very dangerous period of
the case to which Mr. Abernethy's plan has an important relation,
says: "We should adopt the plan suggested by Mr. Abernethy,
as it is the best ever invented by any surgeon." The apparent
discrepancy in the results of the experience of different surgeons,
is rather a matter of degree, and admits of easy explanation.</p>

<p>The feature whence the disease derives its name is merely a
partial exposition of an exceedingly deranged state of the whole
economy, not unfrequently complicated with organic disease. Although
Mr. Abernethy's paper shows that even these cases are
not necessarily fatal, still, in general, such will sooner or later
terminate unfavourably under any treatment; but, in many others,
the explanation which I first suggested has been a satisfactory
solution of the failure: viz. that the principle on which Abernethy
proceeded has not been seized, and that therefore the treatment
has involved direct violations of it. In some, the local
relief has been by no means conducted with the observance of
those conditions which Mr. Abernethy has enjoined. In others,
there has not been even any reasonable approximation to that
careful attention to the general health which is the necessary basis
of the plan.</p>

<p>Another point, which has in some cases impeded the adoption
of the practice, is the increased responsibility it seems to involve.
If a surgeon is to be mistrusted and charged with either, the
"laisser mourir" is much less injurious to him than the "tuer."
What we mean is this: Everything sometimes is going on well,
until the opening of the deposited fluid. If it be left to open by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
the ordinary processes of nature, the subsequent symptoms are
properly enough ascribed to the usual course of the disease; but
if the surgeon has interfered, and, from any circumstances whatever,
the opening does not heal, or bursts soon after from some
slight accident (which has now and then happened), the surgeon
is blamed. The only remedy for this, is to impress the necessary
caution: repose of the part, and so forth.</p>

<p>There is, however, a third point, of great practical consequence,
on which Mr. Abernethy has been misunderstood. I allude to
the local condition under which the puncture should be made.
When, notwithstanding our persevering observance of all measures
calculated to repress the diseased actions, or to procure the
absorption of the deposited fluid, we perceive it to be increasing
or approaching the surface, <i>then, before any inflammation</i> of the
skin has taken place, it should be discharged.</p>

<p>In many cases, <i>this</i> opening has been delayed until the skin
<i>has become inflamed</i>, or much attenuated. Now this risks the
accomplishment of an object which it is a material point with
Mr. Abernethy to secure&mdash;namely, the <i>immediate healing</i> of the
puncture.</p>

<p>On this point, even so good an authority as Sir Astley Cooper
has given a misdirection. "Let the abscess proceed," says Sir
Astley, "until you observe a blush or redness on the skin, and
then adopt Mr. Abernethy's plan." Now this direction does
not absolutely prohibit the opening of the cyst with the object
which Mr. Abernethy had in view; but, as before stated, it deprives
us of <i>one most desirable condition</i>. To settle this point,
we quote Mr. Abernethy's own words. In discussing the point
of time at which the opening should be made, he asks: "Are we
to wait until evident <i>signs of inflammation</i> appear? I think
not." Accordingly, in a case where the surface had become
red, we find he took care to <i>avoid</i> opening it <i>at that part</i>; because
it risked the security of at once healing the puncture.</p>

<p>The truth is, that the <i>whole</i> of the plan is most valuable; but
it must be carefully followed <i>in its integrity</i>; and that this may
be done, the principles on which it is founded must be constantly
kept in mind. These are&mdash;the improvement of the general health,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
with the view of arresting the action of disease, and producing the
absorption of the morbid secretion. This failing, to puncture the
abscess, so as to secure the discharge of its contents without the
admission of air, and on conditions calculated to <i>ensure</i> the immediate
healing of the wound; then to favour the approximation of
the sides of the cavity, by relieving it of its contents, by puncturing
it anew, <i>before</i> it shall have become so much distended.</p>

<p>Another misapprehension has arisen with regard to Mr. Abernethy's
object in excluding air; and unnecessary pains have been
taken to show that the presence of air is not injurious to living
surfaces. It was not from any apprehension of this kind that he
was anxious to exclude the air; but from the tendency that the
<i>presence of air</i> had to favour the <i>putrefactive decomposition</i> of the
new secretion. We must not omit to mention the origin of this
instructive paper, as it is highly characteristic of Abernethy's
acuteness of observation, and his promptitude in the practical
application of it.</p>

<p>A lumbar abscess had been opened by caustic, and when the
eschar had nearly separated, the cyst was partly emptied; the
sides of the cavity collapsing on the imperfectly separated eschar,
the opening was closed, and <i>none of the usual constitutional disturbance
followed</i>. When, however, the eschar, finally separating,
exposed the cyst,&mdash;within twelve hours, the usual dreaded disturbance
of the system supervened. Abernethy took the hint
thus disclosed to him, and produced the improvement, of the merits
of which we have endeavoured to give a brief representation.</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t">HIS ESSAY ON THE SKIN AND LUNGS.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"It is madness and a contradiction to expect that things which were never
yet performed should be effected, except by means hitherto untried."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bacon,
Nov. Org. Aph. 6.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>When we consider the object which the distinguished Author
had in view, in the immortal Work whence we have taken the
foregoing simple but instructive aphorism, we cannot but perceive
how highly suggestive it is to those engaged in scientific researches,
or how necessary to be borne in mind by those who are
really aware of the present state of Medicine and Surgery, and
desirous of seeing them become a definite science. Nor does it
appear inappropriate to the consideration of Abernethy's experimental
inquiries into the functions of the skin and lungs. An
<i>extended</i> investigation&mdash;of which his paper on these subjects
contains an excellent type, and is in part a practical application&mdash;would
be a great step towards the creation of a real science, and
would certainly fall within the "means untried" of Lord Bacon.</p>

<p>Although the latter part of the last century, and the first half
of the present, have been very remarkable for the number of distinguished
men who have flourished during that period, in almost
every branch of knowledge; yet neither the bar nor the senate,
neither literature nor any of the sciences, can boast of greater
men, nor lay claim to more positive improvement, than Chemistry.</p>

<p>If we only consider that interval between the discovery of
oxygen by Priestley, in 1774, and the conclusion of Sir Humphrey
Davy's labours, Chemistry almost seems like a new science;
and it continues to advance with such rapidity, and is daily opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
out so many new questions, that the most accomplished chemist
of one year is never sure how much he may have to learn
the next; nor, unless he reasons with great caution, how much
he may have to <i>un</i>learn.</p>

<p>To a physiologist, who requires assistance <i>from all branches of
science</i>, Chemistry must always be an interesting study. When
we lay aside all speculations as to what is the abstract nature of
Life, and study that which is the proper object of philosophy&mdash;that
to which it seems the faculties of man are limited&mdash;namely,
the <i>laws</i> in obedience to which the phenomena in nature occur;
and apply the knowledge thus obtained to the occurrences which
take place in the human body; we soon discover that, whatever
the abstraction "Life" may be, we live proximately, in virtue of
certain changes in various forms of matter; as food, air, the various
constituents of our bodies, &amp;c.; and that these consist of
multiplied separations and rearrangements of their respective elements,
which it is the special province of Chemistry to examine.</p>

<p>If we investigate the changes of the living, or the structure of
the dead, with these objects,&mdash;we shall be in no danger of perverting
Chemistry to purposes to which it is inapplicable. When,
however, we proceed a step further, and seek to give a <i>chemical
expression</i> to various uses and relations of different parts of the
body, the greatest caution is required.</p>

<p>In the first place, in a machinery which is a practical application
of a great <i>many</i> sciences, it is to the last degree improbable
that they can be expressed by any <i>one</i>.</p>

<p>Again, to estimate the true meaning&mdash;the physiological interpretation
of many changes which might be in their proximate
sense chemical,&mdash;a greater familiarity with the phenomena of
<i>disease</i> is necessary than <i>usually</i> falls within the inquiries of <i>the
most scientific chemist</i>.</p>

<p>To a person acquainted only with the ordinary phenomena of
health, or who is not even something also of a philosophical pathologist,
Chemistry is for ever suggesting tempting analogies,
which are constantly tending to mislead him to conclusions on
insufficient data; and to examine and rest too much on the <i>chemical</i>
facts deducible from one or other function, without sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
attending to the <i>physiological</i> relations of that function
with <i>all</i> others.</p>

<p>In fact, for want of due caution, or it may be of a sufficient
range of information, the assistance which Chemistry has hitherto
rendered to Physiology has been attended with so many assumptions,
that it is extremely difficult to say on which side the balance
lies&mdash;of advantage or error. We are aware that at this moment
there is a contrary feeling&mdash;a kind of <i>furore</i> for <i>chemical</i> solutions
of <i>physiological</i> phenomena. We believe the caution we venture
on suggesting was never more necessary.</p>

<p>The discovery of oxygen gas by Priestley, not only gave a
great impetus to chemical inquiries, but affected Physiology in a
very remarkable manner; when it was found that the <i>more obvious</i>
phenomena of all cases of ordinary burning&mdash;lamps, candles, and
fires of every kind&mdash;consisted mainly of the chemical union of
charcoal and oxygen (carbonic acid); and again, when it was discovered
that animals, in breathing, somehow or other produced a
similar change, one may conceive how ready every one was to
cry, "I have found it. The heat of animals is nothing more than
combustion! We inhale oxygen; we breathe out carbonic acid;
the thing is plain. This is <i>the</i> cause of animal heat!"</p>

<p>It has always struck us as a curious thing that <i>chemists</i> should
have attached such a dominant influence, in the production of
heat in animals, to the union of carbon and oxygen; because nobody
is necessarily so familiar as they are with the fact that the
evolution of heat is not at all <i>peculiar</i> to the union of these
bodies, but is a circumstance common to all changes of every
kind, in all forms of matter&mdash;there always being either the absorption
or the evolution of heat.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the analogy is very striking between
the changes which <i>appear</i> to be wrought in respiration, and those
which take place in ordinary combustion. A very little consideration,
however, shows that the idea that respiration is the cause
of animal heat, or that it is due to any other change of oxygen
merely, is not only an assumption, but in the highest degree
doubtful. In the first place, the carbonic acid thrown out when
we expire, is certainly <i>not</i> made by the immediate union of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
oxygen inspired with the charcoal expired; secondly, nothing is
so obvious that in respiration there is an immense quantity of
heat <i>thrown out</i> of the body. But as it is very desirable that the
subject of this paper of Abernethy's on the Skin and Lungs
should be understood, we will give the reader a simple view of
the nature of these important organs; and as one (functionally
considered) is as much a breathing organ as the other, we will
say a few words first of the lungs.</p>

<p>In all animals<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor"><sup>19</sup></a>, the blood, or other fluid in which the elements
of nutrition are sent to all parts, is exposed to the action
of the air; and this is what we call breathing or respiration; and
the exposing of the blood to air is so arranged that both fluids
are in <i>more or less</i> rapid motion. The staple constituents of the
air, so to speak, are about one-fifth oxygen and four-fifths nitrogen
gases, with about two parts perhaps in a thousand of
carbonic acid; and although, as we too well know, the air is
occasionally polluted by many <i>additions</i>, yet, whether we take air
from the top of Mont Blanc, or a cellar in London, the <i>staple</i>
principles of oxygen and nitrogen have their proportions unchanged.
The air breathed by animals who live in the water is
somewhat differently constituted; the proportion of <i>oxygen</i> is
considerably <i>greater</i>, probably about as much as one-third or
thirty-two parts in one hundred; so that fish breathe a more
<i>highly oxygenated</i> air than we do.</p>

<p>Now it is found that, when we inhale the air of the atmosphere
(that is to say, one-fifth oxygen and four-fifths nitrogen),
we expire some oxygen, some carbonic acid, and some nitrogen
also; and to ascertain the <i>actual changes</i> which took
place, was the object of Abernethy's inquiry.</p>

<p>The subject is one of great interest to the public; and, in
justice to Abernethy, we should remark (that which perhaps a few
more years may render it more important to record), that this
essay was written more than half a century ago&mdash;1793.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>Thousands die every year of affections of the lungs; and
many diseases of these organs, if not in their nature incurable,
have too generally in practice proved to be so. There are not
wanting, however, many persons who ascribe these mournful
results, not so much to the abstract difficulty of the case, as to
imperfect and erroneous views of the functions and relations of
these important organs; and who entertain the opinion that the
investigation of the subject has been, either from preconceived
notions, from a too limited view of the phenomena, or from some
other cause, so infelicitously conducted, that the conclusions arrived
at have been either merely assumptions, extremely doubtful,
or absolutely erroneous.</p>

<p>It is sufficiently obvious that if we are ignorant of the use of
any part of a machine, it must be the most unlikely thing in the
world that we should know how to set about repairing it when
it is out of order; and the matter must be still worse, if we
should happen to ascribe to certain parts of it purposes different
or contrary to that which they as really fulfil. So, in an animal,
if we are ignorant of the use and relations of any organ, it is
very improbable that we can understand the nature of its disorders,
or treat them in any case successfully, except by the
merest accident, which, though it may waken us up to a sense of
our ignorance, leaves us so blind to the causes of our success
that we have no power of repeating it.</p>

<p>Now this is pretty much the actual state of affairs in respect
to diseases of the lungs. No investigation of any organ is worth
anything, unless it include its relations with other organs in the
same machine.</p>

<p>What should we ever learn by looking at the mainspring of
a watch, apart from the general machinery to which it belongs?
Though we should look for ever, and employ a microscope to
boot, it is clear we should never arrive at the perception of its
true relations.</p>

<p>Abernethy's inquiry derived great interest from the investigation
of the skin by which it was preceded, and which seems to
have formed his primary object. A few words on this wonderful
organ may help the unprofessional reader to form some estimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
of its relations and importance. As, in all animals, it is the
surface in immediate contact with external influences&mdash;the first
which attracts our notice&mdash;the first which we instinctively interrogate
as to the state of the animal, so it is of all others the
first which presents to us the evidence of design and adaptation.
We tell the climate an animal inhabits, with moderate certainty,
by looking at the skin; and if we occasionally meet with apparent
exceptions, further examination usually shows that they exemplify
the more strikingly the unity of plan. Thus we may find
animals who inhabit <i>hot</i> regions furnished with a somewhat warm
covering of the skin; as the tiger, for example: but when we
examine the eye, and inquire into the habits of the animal, we
find that he preys or feeds at night, when the atmosphere is
charged with damp and cold.</p>

<p>We know that the animals whence we obtain our furs inhabit
cold regions. The changes in the same animal are not less instructive.
Animals placed in certain circumstances, in which
they require greater warmth, have increase of covering, and <i>vice
versâ</i>. Again, the tendency to become white, in those inhabiting
cold regions, is a very interesting adaptation, although I am not
aware that it has been satisfactorily explained. Two things, however,
are certain: that they are placed in different circumstances
as regards the relation to heat, and would reflect a great quantity
of light, which, in its intensity in snowy regions, might be prejudicial,
as there is no doubt of the influence of this principle in
animals. Again, it is a very common arrangement that animals
should take the colour of the ground they occupy; and this is
sometimes very curiously exemplified. I have observed in the
common hunting-spiders which inhabit some palings in a garden
in the country, that they are of different shades, but they all
more or less resemble that part of the old paling on which they
are found. Those which we see on the ground are generally of
some dark colour. Birds exemplify in a very remarkable manner
the adaptation of their external coverings to the requisitions
which their habits establish. All animals may be said to be
surrounded by an atmosphere of their own, and they are not
therefore, strictly speaking, in contact with the atmosphere; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
when they are exposed to air in motion, this stratum is blown
aside, and the atmosphere is brought in contact with the surface.
Its refrigerating influence is now felt; and, just as a boy cools
his broth by blowing on it, a fresh stratum of cold air is constantly
brought to the surface.</p>

<p>The power of resisting or limiting this refrigerating influence
is somewhat differently conferred in different animals: in
the healthy human subject, by increased activity of the vessels of
the skin, which induces greater heat. Birds, in their rapid flight,
and especially in the more elevated regions of the atmosphere, are
exposed to intensely refrigerating influences. These are met by
the surface being clothed first by fine feathers, the worst of all
conductors of heat, and these are overlapped, where they meet the
atmosphere, in such a way that the bad-conducting property of
the feathers is increased by the mechanical arrangement of them.
Again, the respiration of birds, which (<i>as we contend</i>) is a refrigerating
process, is very restricted; although, for want of due
consideration of all the circumstances, and especially of certain
analogies afforded by insects, very opposite views have been entertained.
Domestic animals (birds inclusive) impressively suggest
the refined adaptation of colour even, of the whole surface, to
the altered position of the individual. Nothing is more striking
than the general uniformity of colour in wild animals&mdash;few things
more familiar than their infinitely varied hues when domesticated.
Now it is certain that these differences have a meaning, and that
their relations are important; but when we extend these thoughts
from the coverings of animals to the consideration of surface,
whether of animals or vegetables, what wonderful things occur to
us. Every variety of colouring which we observe in domestic
animals, every spot on an insect's wing, every pencilling on a
a flower, places the individual in a different relation, so far, to
light, heat, and other powerful agents in nature.</p>

<p>Or if we look from another point of view&mdash;we cannot walk
by a hedge-row in summer without observing how very small the
differences of light and aspect are, which seem on the same soil
to confer on the same species of flowers such numerous varieties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
of colour. I have most frequently observed this in the common
cranes-bill, or wild geranium.</p>

<p>In order to estimate correctly the value of these surfaces to
the animal or vegetable, it is obviously of great importance to us
to know what they do; and if they give off any thing, to ascertain
its nature. That either animal or vegetable may be healthy,
the processes of nature, whatever they are, must be carried on;
and we may be assured, that the fragrance of the rose is just as
necessary an exhalation <i>from</i> the plant, as it is an agreeable impression
<i>to</i> us.</p>

<p>But all animals may be said to breathe quite as much by their
skin as by their lungs. Leaves, too, are the breathing surfaces
of vegetables; and, therefore, to ascertain the facts in the one,
without inquiring into those observable in the other, would be
likely to fog our reasoning and falsify our conclusions. The first
impression we obtain from all animals is from external form and
appearance&mdash;from, in fact, its outward covering. It was the first
organ to which Abernethy devoted his most particular attention;
and here again his investigations show how little those knew of
his mind who imagined that his thoughts were restricted to any
one set of organs.</p>

<p>In whatever light we view it, the skin is, in all animals, a
most important organ; and so much so, as&mdash;drolly enough&mdash;with
the exception of the human subject, to have been long popularly
so considered. Yet so imperfect have been the investigation
of its functions, that we are at this moment chiefly indebted
to the early experiments of Abernethy for what we know that is
positive on the subject. The original experiments of Sanctorius
were quantitative and, as general truths, of sufficient importance
to have excited more attention. Cruikshank's were highly acceptable;
but they were less numerous and less varied than those
of Abernethy; whilst the labours of Edwards, though exhibiting
great industry and zeal, were by no means so conclusive as those
of Abernethy. Edwards' experiments served to strengthen and
confirm, by the analogy afforded by other animals, conclusions
drawn by Abernethy from the more secure premises furnished by
the <i>observation</i> of corresponding functions in man.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Abernethy's inquiry was first directed to ascertain what
the skin actually gave off from the body; and secondly, what
changes took place in the air which we draw into the lungs
(inspiration). We will endeavour to give some idea of these
experiments. They were very simple&mdash;they involved no cruelty,
like those of Edwards&mdash;and they were many of them such as the
public might repeat without difficulty.</p>

<p>Very useful would it be, if persons who have leisure would
sometimes engage in physiological inquiries. They would find
them to be extremely interesting; and a series of facts would
be easily collected, from which the physiologist might obtain the
most valuable information, but which, engaged as most of us are
in applying physiology to the correction of disordered functions,
we can seldom collect for ourselves, except in a few hours stolen
from those occupied in an arduous profession, and perhaps by the
sacrifice of paramount duties.</p>

<p>Mr. Abernethy's experiments were very numerous, and commenced
in the summer of 1791; but the winter's cold obliging
him to desist, they were renewed in the spring of 1792. Having
referred to the experiments of Ingenhous and Cruikshank, together
with an allusion to a paper (not then made public) by Lavoisier,
he proceeds to describe his own.</p>

<p>Having a trough containing a large quantity of quicksilver,
he filled a glass jar (sufficiently capacious to contain his hand
and wrist) with that metal. He inverted it into the trough in
the usual way of proceeding in collecting gases. He fixed the
glass jar in a sloping position, that he might introduce his hand
the more readily beneath the quicksilver. In this way, whatever
was given off from the skin of the hand, rising through the
quicksilver to the top of the glass, and of course displacing a
proportionate quantity of quicksilver, could be made the subject
of analysis.</p>

<p>He describes his first experiment as follows: "I held my
hand ten minutes in the jar beneath the surface of the quicksilver,
and frequently moved it in that situation, in order to
detach any atmospheric air that might accidentally adhere to it,
and afterwards introduced it into the inverted jar. The quicksilver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
<i>soon acquired</i> a degree of warmth which rendered it not
unpleasant. Minute air-bubbles ascended to the top of the
quicksilver, more speedily in the beginning of the experiment,
more tardily towards the conclusion. After an hour had elapsed,
I withdrew my hand; the bubbles of air, which now appeared
on the top of the quicksilver, were, I suppose, in bulk equal to
one scruple of water.</p>

<p>"In <i>sixteen hours</i>, I collected a half-once measure of air, which
makes fifteen grains the average product of an hour. No kind
of moisture appeared on the surface of the quicksilver. Some
sucking-paper was put up, which was withdrawn unmoistened.
My hand was always damp when taken out of the quicksilver.
Whatever aqueous perspiration was produced, adhered to its surface,
whilst the aeriform ascended to the top of the jar. To the air
I had thus collected, I threw up some lime-water<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor"><sup>20</sup></a>, when about
two thirds of it were rapidly absorbed; to the remainder, I
added a bubble of nitrous gas<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor"><sup>21</sup></a>; but could not discover any
red fumes, nor any diminution of the quantity. I repeated
this experiment six times, with similar though not uniform results.
I believe it will be found that the air perspired consists
of carbonic acid gas, or fixed air, a little more than two thirds;
of nitrogenous gas, a little less than one-third. In one experiment,
the nitrogen made only one-fourth part of the air
collected; in another, I thought it exceeded one-third."</p>

<p>He then made a series of experiments of the same kind, but
substituting water for the quicksilver, sometimes heating himself
previously by exercise. The results of these were not materially
different from those in which he held his hand in quicksilver;
but they are less clear, because the carbonic acid gas given off
seemed absorbed by the water. In the next series of experiments,
he held his hand and arm in atmospheric air. In this case,
he found that, in addition to the giving off of carbonic acid,
a portion of the oxygen of the air became absorbed. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
exactly what happens in the lungs. Now, as the carbonic acid,
when given off, is in both cases coincident with the disappearance
of oxygen, and as carbonic acid is composed of oxygen
and carbon, it <i>had been</i> usually conceived that the oxygen taken
in, contributed to form the carbonic acid given off; and the idea
is still entertained very generally.</p>

<p>The experiments of Abernethy, however, presently to be adverted
to, in regard to the skin; and those of Edwards, long
after, in regard to the lungs; satisfactorily prove, we think, that
the carbonic acid is not <i>at all derived</i> in the manner supposed<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor"><sup>22</sup></a>.</p>

<p>To test this matter, Mr. Abernethy confined his hand and
arm in various gases containing <i>no oxygen</i>&mdash;as hydrogen, and
then in nitrogen; but he found the carbonic acid gas <i>still given</i>
off as before. He then placed his hand in a gas (nitrous oxide)
<i>containing</i> oxygen; and lastly, in oxygen itself, to see if it <i>increased</i>,
or otherwise affected the elimination of carbonic acid;
but in neither of those experiments was the carbonic acid thrown
off, <i>increased</i>, or in any way affected by it.</p>

<p>In a subsequent part of the paper, he remarks on the idea
that physiologists entertained of the carbonic acid given off by
the lungs being made by the oxygen inspired; but he says, very
justly, that the quantity of oxygen is too small for the formation
of so much carbonic acid gas as we find given out by those
bodies; and that his experiments on the skin clearly prove that
the exhaling vessels of the skin emit carbonic acid in a state of
<i>complete formation</i>; and then adds, what it is difficult to estimate
the merits of, without recollecting that it was said half a century
ago (and before the experiments of Edwards), "and, doubtless,
those of the lungs perform a similar office."</p>

<p>This is one of those bold, and, we believe, successful reasonings
from analogy which were very characteristic of Abernethy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
The truth is, that even the experiments of Edwards, some of
which were, a long time since, repeated by ourselves, with the
same results, are not, I conceive, so conclusive as the analogy of
Abernethy. It is true, they consisted of placing frogs and other
animals in gases not containing oxygen, when it was found, notwithstanding,
that there was <i>no</i> diminution in the quantity of
the carbonic acid produced, and which therefore could not have
been compounded of any oxygen in the gas. But even here
many possible sources of fallacy suggest themselves. The previous
expulsion <i>of all</i> the oxygen from the animal is obviously a
matter of uncertainty. There are, besides, those sources of fallacy
which are inseparable in some form or other from all experiments
on animals which disturb their natural habits, especially
when these disturbances are so great as to amount to suffering.
From all such experiments Abernethy <i>instinctively</i> shrunk. His
repulsion to them seems not to have rendered it necessary to him
to have shown that they were as <i>physiologically inconclusive</i> as
they were morally questionable. At all events, his present experiments
were not obscured by any such sources of fallacy.</p>

<p>Still the idea of the carbonic acid exhaled by the lungs, being
made up of the union of the carbon exhaled with the oxygen
taken in, continued to be very extensively entertained. We can
only say that to us it seems entirely a child of the imagination;
what Horace calls</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="in0"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">"Mentis gratissimus error;"</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>and shows not only how few people can find leisure to investigate,
but how few venture to observe or think for themselves. Abernethy
also experimented by holding his hand in carbonic acid,
when he found that in about nine hours, three ounces, by measure,
of carbonic acid were absorbed by the skin; and in the remaining
gas, a considerable quantity of other gas which had been
given off, which appeared to be nitrogen.</p>

<p>Desirous of ascertaining the quantity of carbonic acid gas
given off by his hand, in different gases in a single hour, he introduced
his hand into various gases. In the experiment with</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>The test for the carbonic acid was, as before, in all cases, lime-water.
He also found that the skin absorbed oxygen much more
readily than most other gases. One remarkable experiment we
will notice, to show how laborious all these investigations were,
and for the interesting nature of the result. He placed his hand
alternately in vessels containing each twenty-four ounces, by
measure, of nitrogen and oxygen gases. After eight hours' exposure
in each, two-thirds of the oxygen had disappeared,
whereas only <i>one twentieth</i> of the nitrogen was absorbed.
Indeed, there is no one feature of these experiments perhaps
more interesting than those which suggest the stronger aptitude
of the skin to absorb oxygen in comparison with other gases.
For example, Abernethy found that the skin absorbed, by
measure,</p>

<p>Mr. Abernethy then made some experiments on his own
lungs, after the manner that Mr. Cruikshank had done, to find
the quantity of <i>water</i> exhaled, by breathing into glass jars filled
with and inverted in quicksilver, and by other methods, and
also to ascertain the change produced in the air by respiration.
These are all interesting; but we can only give general results,
referring to the work itself, as full of material for thought and
future observation. He considered that, on the whole, the
change in the air was, that in one hundred parts, consisting of</p>

<p class="in0">about <i>three</i> parts of the oxygen were absorbed, whilst about
<i>twelve</i> parts of carbonic acid were exhaled, the nitrogen being
little altered, or even receiving some small addition. The
quantity of <i>inspired</i> oxygen which disappeared varied in different
experiments, probably depending on the depths of the inspiration,
and the duration between it and the following expiration&mdash;the
time, in fact, during which it was retained in the lungs.
The smallest quantity which disappeared was one-twelfth; the
largest, one-sixth. The moisture (water) exhaled, he found to be
about three drachms in an hour.</p>

<p>These experiments, for the particulars of which we must refer
to the book itself, contain a calculation of the extent of surface
of the body, which he estimates at about two thousand seven
hundred square inches&mdash;that is, about thirty-eight times that of
the hand and wrist, on which he experimented. Thus, if we
multiply any of the results he obtained by thirty-eight, we shall
obtain some idea of the prodigious power of this wonderful
organ, and of the vast influence which its various conditions
must exert on the whole animal economy. The whole of the experiments
in the paper are just as interesting as ever, and would,
we are well persuaded, be found amply to repay further investigation.</p>

<p>They exemplify in every line his clearness of thought, and
his care in deducing no other conclusion from the premises than
that which they logically justify. The observations which he has
annexed to his paper also are just, and of great practical value;
they discuss the bearing that the whole has to the relation which
exists between the skin and lungs, and the influence of this on
the causes of that fell destroyer, popularly known under the title
of Consumption.</p>

<p>They are a portion of that investigation of relation between
various organs, on which anything like the formation of a definite
and practical science must ultimately depend. We shall endeavour,
in the sequel, to explain the ulterior consequences which
necessarily arise out of such considerations, when they are duly
followed out. We shall endeavour to point out the share they
had, in conjunction with other considerations, in leading to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
beautiful and simple principles which Mr. Abernethy was led
more especially to advocate; and show how far <i>he</i> went, as describing
the starting point of those who have endeavoured at a
fuller development of the consequences of his views.</p>

<p>He remarks, justly enough, on the determination to the lungs
consequent on the repression of the surface, and the necessary
<i>additional duty thrown on those</i> important organs engaged in a
common function with the skin, where the duty of the latter is
not performed; and on the elements thus supplied for disease,
<i>especially</i> in persons of restricted chest; relations, <i>be it remembered</i>,
which exist between the various other organs of the
economy, and which exemplify in a single case truly, what has
been, we trust, since shown in regard to organs generally; how
the organ, which may be the seat of the <i>disease</i>, <i>may not be</i> the
seat of the original <i>cause</i>, but really a secondarily affected organ&mdash;a
hint which, when followed out, is of <i>immense practical
importance</i>.</p>

<p>The skin is by no means the only organ which has a community
of function with the lungs, or through which these important
parts become affected; but if this be so, and diseases of
the lungs be treated as an <i>integral thing</i>, it requires no great
penetration to see how diseases so handled must be incurable;
since the real cause may never be ministered to.</p>

<p>Again, if a case should be successfully treated, by means
which afford all possible relief to the <i>lungs</i>, whilst the <i>primarily
affected</i> organ is also properly treated, it by no means follows
that the treatment should be the same in <i>every case</i>; for the
primarily affected organ may be different in different cases. There
is, in fact, no organ of the body which, when subjected to disordering
influences, may not <i>secondarily</i> affect the lungs.</p>

<p>The liver is especially apt to affect them. It is engaged, like
the lungs, in throwing off large quantities of carbon or charcoal
from the system, and has been not very improperly termed the
"abdominal lung." It is constantly also sending through the
medium of the heart a large quantity of blood to the lungs.
Now, if this blood have not the proper quantity of carbon extracted
from it by the liver, or if even the blood be excessive in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
quantity, why the lungs must have more to do; and many
diseased lungs have been produced in this manner in cases where
the chest has been well formed.</p>

<p>There are, however, many intimate relations between organs
which do not depend on mere community of function. It is very
important that the public should have clear views on this subject;
and if they would only give a little of that attention which
they so often bestow on things infinitely more difficult, there is
no doubt many lives would be saved that are irremediably
damaged, as Abernethy says, sometimes even before any symptoms
have suggested that there is anything the matter.</p>

<p>But if there be a shadow of truth in Mr. Abernethy's views,
and still more in those extensions of them to which they have
naturally led, we may learn how necessary is that discrimination
which traces disease to <i>primarily</i> affected organs; and how little
success we may expect by treating the lungs, as the integral seat
of disease, by specifics, or such remedies as tar, naphtha, cod-liver
oil, various gases, &amp;c. which come in and go out of fashion in a
manner sufficiently significant of the claims they can have in a
scientific point of view.</p>

<p>Mr. Abernethy also remarks on the comparatively restricted
influence of scrofula in constituting consumption. "At one
time," he observes, "I examined the bodies of many people who
died of consumption." After describing other appearances
which he found, he says, "the greater number were bestudded
with larger or smaller tubercles, or <i>made uniformly dense</i> (consolidated)."
He says, this disease (consolidation) is <i>very insidious</i>,
that it is often established beyond the possibility of removal
before it is suspected; but, he says, he thinks it might be known,
for the capacity of the lungs is diminished; and suggests that
this should be tested, by allowing a suspected case to <i>breathe
into a glass vessel over water</i>, by which the quantity of air
they can receive is rendered perceptible.</p>

<p>His remarks, too, on the treatment are highly interesting and
discriminative, and will not only well repay attentive perusal, but
that study which is necessary to the perception of their full force
and beauty. When we have to sum up the various influences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
of the views of Abernethy, we may probably find space for a few
facts on that which they exert on the treatment of the lungs and
skin; and this not merely as affecting the health in general,
but also complexion, and other conditions of these curious and
important organs.</p>

<p>We are unwilling to dismiss this paper without directing
attention to the illustration it affords of the erroneous views of
those who imagine that Abernethy's investigations were confined
to the digestive organs, and still less, of course, to one of them
(the stomach). It would, on the contrary, be difficult to find
any paper on physiology so comprehensive in its views, so simple
and clear as to its object, so cautious and logical in its reasonings,
so free from any bias, or with so little reference, either directly
or indirectly, to what are usually understood by the digestive
organs. On the other hand, it is an investigation which (as regards
the relation which exists between two organs having a
common function) is an exact type of what physiological investigation
should be. For we have only to extend the idea of a
relation which exists between <i>two</i> organs, to those which exist
between <i>all</i> organs; to regard as their <i>combined</i> functions, the
sustentation of the life and health of the individual, just as we
have been regarding respiration, the common function of the
skin and lungs; and we thus arrive at what must be the basis
of any sound or comprehensive inquiry into the true relations of
the various parts of the economy; by which alone we can interpret
the phenomena of health and disease.</p>

<p>Moreover&mdash;however presumptuous the assertion may appear
on the one hand, or however humiliating the view it implies of
the present state of medicine as a science on the other&mdash;we must
regard this investigation, in every philosophical sense of the term,
as still among the "means untried" of the illustrious author
whose words we have ventured to place at the head of this

<p>Perhaps, of all known torments, there is none that can be
compared, either in intensity or duration, with that curious disease
which has been called Tic Doloreux. Like the term Neuralgia,
it is merely a hard word to express a violent pain in a nerve.
Conventionally, the term neuralgia, or nerve-pain, is generally
used to express a case where the suffering is of a more or less
diffused character. The term "tic" is more usually applied in
cases where the seat of pain is found in some superficial nerve.
Neither term has much claim to the character of scientific nomenclature;
they are merely equivalent to saying that we know
very little of the matter. This obscurity, however, may be soon
lessened, if not entirely cleared, by any one who will go to work
in the way suggested by Mr. Abernethy's principles, and in which,
to a certain point, they will conduct him. He must, however,
recollect that the pain, though a most distressing symptom, is
still a <i>symptom</i>, and not the <i>disease</i> which gives rise to it.</p>

<p>This disease teaches us how beneficently framed we are in
relation to all around us; and how small a deviation from a
healthy condition of our sensations converts all usual sources of
pleasure into so many elements of agony. The breeze, of late so
grateful and refreshing, may produce more suffering than would
be excited by the most intensely-heated furnace. In other cases,
the cool spring, or the most delicious fruit, become causes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
torture. We should exceed all reasonable limits if we were to
enumerate all the usual sources of pleasure which, in different
cases, are converted into so many instruments of suffering.</p>

<p>Tic doloreux is indeed a horrible malady; but one which,
when properly considered, becomes very instructive. It admirably
illustrates the views of Abernethy; and how ready he was to
concede all that examination of the views of others which
modesty and common sense require, as well as how superior his
own were, both in philosophical acumen and practical value; first
examining the views of others, and finding them defective, he,
with the true philosophical spirit which first discovers what is
wrong&mdash;</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="in0">"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Primus gradus est sapientiæ falso intelligere</span>,"</p>
</blockquote>


<p class="in0">then proceeds to develop his own.</p>

<p>The nerves are the organs from which we receive all our impressions
from without; and when their ordinary sensibility is
thus morbidly augmented, we may be persuaded that there is
<i>something</i> very wrong within.</p>

<p>The tic doloreux is one of the examples showing how cautious
and circumspect, and how modest withal, Abernethy was in
advancing to his own comprehensive views of disease; and how
entirely antithetical the method he pursued in arriving at them
was to that which attempts to cut the knot of difficulty by gratuitous
hypotheses.</p>

<p>When this disease first began to attract attention, it was suggested
that it might be cured by the division of the nerve. The
phenomena of the nervous system afforded abundant grounds for
mistrusting the soundness of this view. The tendency, however,
to confound the more salient symptom of a disease with its intrinsic
nature, caused such phenomena to be overlooked or little
considered; and the consequence was, that where the nerve was
divided, the treatment was sometimes entirely confined to that
proceeding.</p>

<p>In the end, the operation disappointed expectation; and
that which careful reasoning might have predicted as probable,
was left to be determined by experiment, In some cases, circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
concurred to produce temporary relief; but on the whole
the operation was a failure.</p>

<p>In the case he here published, Abernethy removed a little bit
of nerve from a lady's finger. As she had suffered severely, and
he was anxious to give her more permanent relief, he did not rest
satisfied with merely dividing the nerve. For about nine months
the lady was in comparative ease; but then the sensation returned.
He remarks on the interest attached to this return of sensation,
and observes on the analogy it suggests between the supply of
blood, and that of nervous power. For if the vessels conveying
the former be tied or obstructed, the supply is gradually restored
through collateral channels. The return of the nervous functions,
after the removal of a portion of the nerve, seemed to
favour that view of the nervous system which regarded as the
proximate cause of the phenomena some subtle principle or
other, like electricity or magnetism, or some analogous power, of
which the nerves might be the conductors.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting fact of this case, however, was
the significant bearing it had on those views which he was beginning
to deduce from a multitude of other sources. The fact
being, that when the lady died, which she did about four years
afterwards, <i>she died of disordered digestive organs</i>. Showing,
therefore, at least, the coincidence of the most severe form of
nervous disturbance with disorder of these important functions.</p>

<p>We shall see, by and by, that Mr. Abernethy made this and
other cases the instruments of much future good; but as we shall
not be able to digress from that Summary of our obligations,
which we shall then be employed in taking, we will add a few
words here in aid of removing that difficulty which some people
have in understanding how such dreadful pain can result from
any organ in the interior of the body, where no pain is felt at
all. In order to do this, it is only necessary to have a clear
general notion of the nervous system. If you could take away
everything but the nerves, you would have the brain, spinal marrow,
and certain knot-like pieces of nervous substance (ganglions,
as we term them) from which myriads of cords proceeded, varying
in size from the smallest imaginable filaments up to moderate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
sized cords; the ends of the delicate filaments terminating in the
various organs and on the surface of the body; millions of messengers
of the most extreme sensibility, by which impressions are
telegraphed with the swiftness of lightning between all parts of
the body. There is, however, a habit or rule which is ordinarily
observed, and that is one of the most curious things in the whole
range of physiology&mdash;namely, that the immediate cause of our
recognition of sensation is never in the part itself, but the action
is constantly transferred to the extremity of the nerve. When
you strike the ulnar nerve at the elbow (popularly termed, sometimes,
the funny-bone), you feel it in the fingers to which its
branches are distributed.</p>

<p>If you place your finger in cold or warm water, the action
that makes you feel it is in the brain; and we infer this, because
if we divide the communication between the brain and the finger,
you no longer feel the sensation. Now, bearing this in mind,
you easily understand how anything disturbing the nerves of any
internal organ may produce pain in some distant branch; and
that this is really so, many cases of tic doloreux have furnished
conclusive and triumphant proofs. Now, as to <i>why</i> it should be
seated in this or that particular site, is a question of extreme difficulty;
as also in what organ the primary disturbance is seated,
supposing it to have been in any of them. The former, I believe,
is a question we have yet been unable to solve; the <i>latter</i> may
usually be accomplished, <i>if sufficient pains be taken</i>.</p>

<p>Abernethy, in his lectures on this subject, when observing
on the inefficiency of this division of the nerve&mdash;which was
ministering to effects only&mdash;was accustomed to remark, with that
peculiar archness of expression which his pupils must so well
remember: "I wonder that it never entered into the head of
some wise booby or other to divide the nerve going to a gouty
man's toe." This was a very characteristic mode of terminating
a discussion of any point which he wished to impress on the
memory of the pupil.</p>

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">SECTION.<br />
OF HIS PAPER ON OCCASIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF BLEEDING.</p>

<p>In these days of improved statistical inquiry, it would be a
curious document which should give us the comparative number
of persons who are now bled, and that of only fifty years ago;
and whilst it would present very instructive data as to the progress
of medical science, it would give also some significant hints
as to the relations of fashionable remedies. First, almost every
barber was a bleeder; and within my own recollection, a lady,
who for any serious ailment consulted the most eminent physician
in the neighbourhood in which she lived, would allow no one to
bleed her but the barber.</p>

<p>Formerly, multitudes of people lost a little blood every "spring
and fall." Accidents of all kinds afforded a fine opportunity for
bleeding. The papers announced accidents generally by the usual&mdash;"It
is with regret that we learn that Sir Harry &mdash;&mdash; was thrown
from his horse in the Park. It was feared that the honourable
baronet had sustained serious injury; but, fortunately, Mr.
Sharpe was on the spot, so that the patient was immediately
bled. He was conveyed home, and we rejoice to hear that he
is doing well. The accident, which it had been feared was a
fracture, proved to be only a 'dislocation.'"</p>

<p>The questions in regard to bleeding were said to be&mdash;who,
when, and how much (<i>quis, quando, quantum?</i>); but, to our minds,
Aretæus has a better saying: "When bleeding is required, there
is need of deliberation (<i>cum sanguinem detrahere oportet, deliberatione
indiget</i>)." We like this better; because, in addition
to the little words quoted above, it suggests another, more important
than either&mdash;namely, <i>cur?</i> why&mdash;on many occasions, a
favourite inquiry of Abernethy's.</p>

<p>We recollect a surgeon being called to a gentleman who was
taken ill suddenly, and he found two or three servants and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
medical attendant struggling very vigorously with the patient.
Whilst this was continuing, the first question put to the surgeon
by the medical attendant was:</p>

<p>"Shall I bleed him, Sir?"</p>

<p>"Why should you desire to bleed him?"</p>

<p>"Oh! exactly; you prefer cupping?"</p>

<p>"Why should he be cupped?"</p>

<p>"Then shall I apply some leeches?"</p>

<p>This, too, was declined; in short, it never seemed to have
occurred that neither might be necessary, still less that either
might therefore do mischief.</p>

<p>It is the most curious thing to see the force of a well-grown
conventionalism. As long as it led to moderately bleeding plethoric
baronets in recent accidents, no great harm would have
been done; but the frequency in other cases, in which bleeding
was instituted with "apparent impunity," was too commonly
construed into "bleeding with advantage," until the practice
became so indiscriminate as to be extensively injurious. <i>Now</i>,
comparatively, few persons are bled; and some few years ago I
had a curious illustration of it.</p>

<p>In a large institution, relieving several thousand patients
annually, and in which, a very few years before, scarcely a day
passed without several persons having been bled; nearly a month
elapsed without a single bleeding having been prescribed by either
of the three medical officers.</p>

<p>No doubt many persons are still bled without any very satisfactory
reason; but we believe that the abuse of bleeding is much
diminished, and that the practice is much more discriminate and
judicious. From this, and perhaps other causes, a very important
class of cases which engaged the attention of Abernethy, as it
had that of Hunter before him, is become comparatively infrequent.
When bleeding, however, was practised, with as little
idea of its importance as some other of the barber-surgeon's
ministrations, on all sorts of people, and in all sorts of disturbed
states of health, and probably with no attention at all to the
principles which should alike guide the treatment of the largest
or the smallest wound; this little operation was frequently followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
by inflammation of the vein, nerve, or other contiguous
structures. These cases were, most of them, more or less serious,
often dangerous, and occasionally fatal.</p>

<p>Taking up the subject where it had been left by Mr. Hunter,
Abernethy refers to the cases published in the two volumes of the
"Medical Communications," by Mr. Colly of Torrington, and by
Mr. Wilson, and then proceeds to give some of his own. It is
in this paper that he first moots two questions which have since
grown into importance, by an extension of some of the practices
to which they refer. We allude to the division of fasciæ, and
tendinous structures, and also of nerves in states of disease or
disorder.</p>

<p>In many cases we see, in the application of such measures,
how much that clear and quick-sighted discrimination is required
which so eminently distinguished Abernethy. He, however, only
<i>mooted</i> these questions at that time; for he observes that he had
not had sufficient experience to give an opinion. The chief value
of the paper <i>now</i> is, the good sense with which it inculcates a
more careful and cleanly performance of bleeding; a more scientific
treatment of the puncture, by neatly bringing its edges into
apposition, and by keeping the <i>arm quiet</i> until it has healed.
Neglect of these cautions in disordered states of constitution,
had no doubt been not infrequently accessory to the production
of some of the serious consequences against which it is the object
of this paper to guard. I need scarcely observe that the whole
subject is important, and should be thoroughly studied by the
young surgeon.</p>

<p>In 1793, Abernethy, by his writings and his lectures, seems
to have created a general impression that he was a man of no
ordinary talent. His papers on Animal Matter, and still more
his Essay on the functions of the Skin and Lungs, had shown
that he was no longer to be regarded merely in the light of a
rising surgeon, but as one laying claim to the additional distinction
of a philosophical physiologist. The subject (of the skin and
lungs) had engaged the attention of Böerhaave a long time before;
Cruikshank also, and other very able men, had followed in
the same wake of investigation; therefore there was an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
of that test which comparison alone affords. Abernethy
was, in fact, regarded at this time more in the light of a rising
man, than merely a promising surgeon. He now moved from
St. Mary Axe (as I am informed), and took a house in St. Mildred's
Court, in the Poultry.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Blicke had moved to Billiter Square. I find, by
the rate-books, which Mr. B. L. Jones was so good as to inspect
for me, that this was in April, 1793. He could hardly fail at
this time to have had a very acceptable portion of practice, although
we apprehend it was not as yet extensive. His reputation
was, however, fast increasing, which the attention paid to his
opinion at the hospital at this time must have materially accelerated.</p>

<p>Certainly not later than 1795, there were very few cases of
doubt or difficulty, in which (independently of that participation
in the consultation at the hospital common to all the medical
officers) there was not especial value and influence attached to
his opinion; and I have heard a pupil of that day assert, that in
cases of real doubt and difficulty, there was nothing more beautiful
in itself, nor more characteristic of Abernethy, than the
masterly way in which he would analyze a case, bring the practical
points before his colleagues, and at the same time suggest
the course he preferred. As, from his other occupations, it would
often happen that some consultation might be pending whilst he
was engaged at the theatre or in the museum, it would often
happen that a consultation would terminate for the time by some
one observing: "Well, we will see what Mr. Abernethy says on
the subject."</p>

<p>In 1796, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society, his old
preceptor, Sir William Blizard, being one of those who signed
the proposal for his election. He only contributed one paper
after this to the "Philosophical Transactions." After his death,
the Duke of Sussex pronounced a very well-deserved eulogium,
of which a copy will be found in another part of this volume.
He had not been idle, however; but, in 1797, published the
third part of the "Physiological Essays," which we will consider
in the next place.</p>

<p>In estimating the practical penetration and clear judgment of
Abernethy, it was almost necessary to see him placed by the side
of other men.</p>

<p>His mind was so quick at perceiving the difficulties which lay
around any subject, that it appeared to radiate on the most difficult,
a luminosity that made it comparatively easy, by at least
putting that which, to ordinary minds, might have been a confused
puzzle, into the shape of an easy, definite, and intelligible
proposition.</p>

<p>It was immaterial whether the difficulties were such as could
be overcome, or whether they were in part insurmountable; both
were clearly placed before you; and whilst the work of the
quickest mind was facilitated, the slowest had the great assistance
of seeing clearly what it had to do.</p>

<p>All this was done by Abernethy in a manner so little suggestive
of effort, that, like his lecturing, it was so apparently
easy, that one wondered how it happened that nobody could ever
do it so well.</p>

<p>But when we saw him placed in juxtaposition with other men,
these peculiarities, which, from the easy manner in which they
were exhibited, we had perhaps estimated but lightly, were thrown
into high relief, and by contrast showed the superiority of his
powers.</p>

<p>The second series of Essays he had dedicated to his old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
master, Sir Charles Blicke. The third, the subject of our present
consideration, he inscribed to his early instructor in anatomy,
Sir W. Blizard. The dedication is straightforward and grateful.</p>

<p>The first paper of the series is interesting in two points of
view. First, it was an important improvement in the management
of a difficult form of a very serious class of accidents&mdash;"Injuries
of the Head;" and secondly, it derives a peculiar interest
from the parallelism it suggests between Abernethy and
one of the most distinguished surgeons of France, the celebrated
Pierre Joseph Desault&mdash;a parallelism honourable to both, yet
remarkably instructive as to the superior discriminative powers
of Abernethy. Desault's pupil, Bichat, himself one of the most
accomplished anatomists of his time, has left an eloquent eulogium
on Desault, which, although somewhat florid, is by no means
above his merits. He says he was the father of Surgical Anatomy
in France; and certainly few men evinced more sagacity, in that
immediate application of a fact to practical purposes which constitutes
art, than Desault.</p>

<p>Bichat, in his glowing analysis of Desault's character, amongst
other things in relation to his study of the profession, observes of
him that "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Un esprit profond et réfléchi, ardent à entreprendre,
opiniâtre à continuer, le disposa de bonne heure à surmonter
des dégoûts qui précédent, et les difficultés qui accompagnent
son étude. A cet âge où l'âme encore fermée à la réflexion
semble ne s'ouvrir qu'au plaisir, apprendre fut son premier
besoin&mdash;savoir sa première jouissance&mdash;devancer les autres sa
première passion</span><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor"><sup>23</sup></a>."</p>

<p>A quick and clear perception, for the most part untrammelled
by preconceived opinions, led Desault to a vivid appreciation of
the immediate results of surgical proceedings; and as these were
definite, successful, doubtful, or abortive, he either persevered
with a characteristic tenacity of purpose, or at once and for ever
abandoned them. He was remarkably happy in his selection and
appreciation of the mechanical parts of surgery; and his quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
perception disclosed to him several useful points in practice which
depend on the more important truths of medical surgery.</p>

<p>Now <i>almost</i> all this, as applied to the active portion of Abernethy's
life, is equally true of both. But Desault was by no
means so deep or so original a thinker as Abernethy. Like Abernethy,
he was clear and penetrative; but he did not see nearly so
far, nor were his views nearly as comprehensive. Desault was
quick at detecting an error in practice, and in sensibly rejecting
it. Abernethy would unfold it, examine it, and, by his talents,
convert the very defect into usefulness. Desault had by no means,
in the same degree, that power of reflection, that suggestive faculty,
which, in endeavouring to interpret the meaning of phenomena,
can point out the true question which it is desired to ask
of nature, as well as the mode of inquiry.</p>

<p>All this, and much more, was strikingly developed in Abernethy.
The paper before us involves a subject which had engaged
the attention both of Abernethy and Desault. They had
met with the same difficulty; and the practical solution of it
which each obtained, though somewhat different, was extremely
characteristic. We will try to make this intelligible. In severe
injuries in which the cranium is broken, it frequently happens
that a portion of bone is so displaced that it presses on the brain.
The consequence of this, in <i>many cases</i>, is a train of symptoms
sufficiently alarming in themselves, but the actual cause of which
many circumstances sometimes concur to complicate or obscure.</p>

<p>The same forces which produce the accident not unfrequently
involve a violent shock to the whole body. Sometimes fracture
or other injury of other parts. Sometimes the patient is deeply
intoxicated. Then, again, patients are presented to the surgeon,
in different cases, at extremely different intervals after the reception
of the injury; so that a case may wear a very different aspect
according to period or the phase at which it is first brought under
his observation.</p>

<p>These and many other circumstances give rise to various modifications
of the symptoms, and, <i>under some complications</i>, constitute
a class of cases which yield to none in importance or difficulty.
There is something in the idea of a piece of bone pressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
on the brain, which instinctively suggests the expediency of raising
it to the natural level. This is, in fact, the object of what is
called "trepanning;" or, as we generally term it, "trephining."</p>

<p>The operation is very simple; it consists in carefully perforating
the cranium, and then, by means of an instrument adapted
for that purpose, restoring the piece of bone, which has been depressed,
to its natural level. In many instances, the proceeding
was very successful; but in many others, the cases terminated
unfavourably. From what has been already hinted, it is clear
that, in many injuries of the head, this trephining must have
been unnecessary; in others, inapplicable; and in both (as adding
to the injury), mischievous. Still, surgeons went on as
before; so that, in a large class of injuries of the head, there was
(if the bone was depressed) an almost uniform recourse to the
trephine.</p>

<p>Again, in cases where it did not immediately appear that the
bone was depressed, too often very unnecessary explorative operations
were undertaken to determine that circumstance. In short,
there was too much of analogy between the matter-of-course
adoption of the trephine in severe injuries of the cranium, and
that which we have noticed in regard to bleeding in more ordinary
accidents.</p>

<p>For correcting the abuse of this very serious operation, we are
under great obligations to Abernethy and Desault; and we couple
these illustrious names together on this occasion, because, although
the amount of our obligation to Abernethy is much the
greater, we would not willingly omit the justice due to Desault.</p>

<p>Desault may have been said to have given the first blow,
which so often determines the ultimate fate of a mischievous conventionalism&mdash;that
blow which <i>compels the consideration</i> of its
claims on our common sense.</p>

<p>Desault had become extremely disgusted with the results of
the operation of the trephine in his hands at the Hôtel Dieu;
and, on consideration, although, as it would seem from Bichat's
edition of his works, he did not in theory absolutely ignore the
occasional propriety of the operation, he practically for ever
abandoned it; thus at once cutting the knot he felt it difficult or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
impracticable to unravel. As this was many years before his
death, the principal argument on which he supported the relinquishment
of the operation was simply that his success in the
treatment of injuries of the head had been much greater since he
had altogether laid it aside.</p>

<p>This is eminently characteristic of what people call "a practical
man;" but, after all, it is not very sound reasoning. Now,
here it was that the discriminative excellence of Abernethy began
to tell.</p>

<p>In the first place, he observed that the raising of the bone
could only be necessary <i>where it produced symptoms</i>. He also
observed that experience had recorded certain cases in which, notwithstanding
that the bone had been depressed, the patients had
recovered without any operation. Then again he thought it not
improbable that, where the depression was slight, even though
some symptoms might at first arise, yet, if we were not too precipitate,
we might find that they would again subside, and thus
so serious an operation be rendered unnecessary. These and
similar reasonings led him to recommend a more cautious practice,
and to refrain from trephining, even where the bone <i>was
depressed</i>, except on conditions which referred to the general
effects of pressure <i>on the brain</i>, rather than to the abstract fact
of depression of the bone.</p>

<p>He did not stop here; but having thus placed restrictions on
the use of the trephine, where it had been too indiscriminately
employed, he then describes the practice which is to be pursued
where the pressure is produced from <i>effusion</i> on the brain.</p>

<p>Although, in laying down the rules to be observed in such
cases, there is much of painful uncertainty as to the existence of
effused blood, the site it may occupy, and other circumstances of
embarrassment,&mdash;still the rules he proposes in relation to the
avoidance of large vessels, the condition of the bone as indicative
of the actual state of the parts beneath it, &amp;c. are all clearly and
beautifully stated, as deducible from the anatomical and vascular
relations of the parts. The result of all this discrimination is,
that the trephine is seldom employed, whilst the treatment of the
various injuries of the head is much more successfully conducted.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>He next proceeds to consider the distinction between those
cases in which the brain has been <i>shaken</i> merely (concussion),
and those where it has been subjected to mechanical pressure.
There are two points in this part of the paper of great interest to
the practical surgeon: the one in which he treats of the distinction
of the two cases; the other, in which he marshals the discordant
practices of different surgeons in cases of concussion, and
defines the proper phase of the case in which we may make them
respectively applicable. When, for example, we may by warmth
maintain, or even by cautious stimulation excite, the depressed
powers; or, by judicious abstinence from either, avoid provoking
too violent reaction; and, lastly, how we should combat the
latter, if it unfortunately supervene.</p>

<p>His Remarks on the Assistance to be derived from the consideration
of the Phenomena of Apoplexy, his reference to the
cases which had occurred in the practice of other surgeons, and
the observations he makes on the lamentable <i>omission of facts in
the record of cases</i>, are all worthy of profound attention. Equally
excellent is the ingenuity with which he attempts the distinction
between the cases of concussion, and compression, of the brain.
His endeavour to discriminate the cases in which the effusion, or
inflammatory action, respectively, affect one or other membrane,
is also extremely sagacious and characteristic. Whether we consider
all or any of these features in the paper before us; or, lastly,
that triumph of science and humanity with which he has so defined
the limits of a dangerous operation, as to have achieved a
comparative abandonment of it; we think most surgeons will be
inclined to regard this essay as one of his happiest contributions
to the improvement of practical science.</p>

<p>In 1804, he added some cases in illustration of the views unfolded
in this paper; and one case which appeared to be exceptional,
with what he considered to be its appropriate explanation.
He also gives an interesting case of a suicide, in whom he had
tied the carotid artery, and in whom the operation was followed
by an inflammatory state of the brain. Here, again, his quick
perception suggested to him the significant idea that <i>similar</i> conditions
of brain might result from <i>different</i> and even <i>opposite</i> states<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
of the circulation&mdash;a conclusion now, I believe, well established;
one of great practical importance; and one for which, so far as I
know, we are greatly indebted to the observations of Dr. Marshall
Hall on blood-letting. In this case, Abernethy eulogizes the
plan recommended by Desault, of feeding a patient by a tube introduced
through the left nostril. In concluding this remarkable
paper, which shows how much a great mind may extract from
common subjects&mdash;</p>

<p class="in0">we quote one remark, which impresses the importance of a requisition,
the essential basis of all scientific inquiries&mdash;namely, a
careful collection of facts.</p>

<p>"In proportion as we advance in knowledge," says Mr. Abernethy,
"we are led to record many circumstances in the progress

<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">ABERNETHY'S EXPERIMENTS ON THE MUSCLES IN FROGS, ETC.</p>

<p>"There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt
of in your philosophy, Horatio," is a sentiment which, in some
form or other, occurs to the most uninformed peasant, and to the
most profound philosopher.</p>

<p>The very small difference between the acquisitions of the two,
however marvellous when viewed abstractedly, sinks into nothing
when compared to the secrets of nature which yet remain unexplored.
This comparison is the true source of that humility
which, while it adds dignity to the acquirements of intellect, is
the foundation on which we may most securely rest the hope of
increasing possessions.</p>

<p>The intellectual vision of the wisest man confines him to a
very small area, when compared with the boundless realms of
nature. There are, indeed, a number of objects within the range
of his perceptions whose nature and relations he has the power of
examining; but there are also a multitude of others which, from
their dimly sketched outline, he feels to be beyond the bounds
assigned to his limited faculties.</p>

<p>One of the most curious things in animals is the rigidity or
stiffness of their muscles after death. It is, as it were, the last
effort of the living principle. This phenomenon may be indefinitely
modified by particular states, by lightning, by poison, and
other peculiar conditions, induced by the manner and the period
at which the death may have occurred; and in all cases it continues
but for a short time. It is the last exercise of that power
which resides in muscles or flesh, of contracting, and thus moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
the various parts to which it is attached. In a very large sense,
this power is under the dominion of the will, and enables animals
to move as their instincts or their wants suggest.</p>

<p>Now it is a curious thing to think that this power can be excited
after death, by placing the parts between two pieces of metal,
or galvanizing them; so called after the name of the discoverer,
Galvani.</p>

<p>It is difficult, at this day, to imagine the astonishment of the
wife of Galvani, or his pupil, when first they observed the leg of
a dead frog thrown into convulsions on being touched by a piece
of metal. Such, however, was the apparently simple origin of a
long series of wonderful discoveries. It has been well observed,
however, that "discoveries, apparently the result of accident,
always imply the exercise of profound thought." And this was
no less the case in respect to galvanism. A fact, which, but for
the mention of it to Galvani by his wife, might have passed unobserved,
was, by the scarcely less than creative power of mind,
improved into a most important branch of human science.</p>

<p>Ignorant as men still remain of the <i>intrinsic nature</i> of the
principle or power which gives rise to the phenomenon, the observation
and study of <i>its laws</i> and <i>operations</i> have led to discoveries
which, in their value, their importance, and their surprising
character, yield to no other yet achieved.</p>

<p>Abernethy, who, at this laborious period of his life, had his
observation directed everywhere, made some experiments on this
power (galvanism), in its relations to the muscles of frogs.</p>

<p>His object seems to have been as follows: Fontana (a celebrated
physiologist, born in the Tyrol about 1734) had showed
that a muscle which could no longer be excited to contract under
water, might be excited anew, if taken out of the water, and exposed
for some time to air. This observation had suggested the
idea that air was in some way or other conducive to this "irritability,"
as it was termed. Dr. Girtanner had also endeavoured
to prove that the irritability depended on the oxygen taken into
the blood during respiration; and further, that it was in a direct
ratio to the quantity of oxygen respired&mdash;"an opinion which some
writers in this country seem disposed to adopt."</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>Abernethy doubted the soundness of such a view, and he
accordingly instituted some experiments, in the hope that if he
could not absolutely determine the question, he might throw
some light on it. His experiments were very numerous, but he
published only a few of them. We will give one or two.
"<i>Having killed a frog</i> (for he properly objected to experiments
on <i>living</i> animals), he experimented on the muscles of two legs;
one was put into a bottle containing oxygen gas procured from
manganese, and which was very pure; the other into a bottle
containing atmospheric air; the quantity in each bottle was
about six ounces by measure; the limbs were supported in the
gases, and wholly surrounded by them. After five hours, the
muscles had nearly ceased to act in both limbs; those, however,
of the thigh belonging to that limb inclosed in the <i>common
air</i> acted more vividly than the others, but in a little time even
these could no longer be excited. Upon comparing the limbs
afterwards, the muscles of that limb which had been exposed to
the oxygen gas were evidently the most flabby. Several other
trials were made with a similar result;" whence he observes: "I
am disposed to conclude that oxygenous gas has <i>no greater
power</i> of supporting the irritability of parts <i>separated</i> from the
animal than the common atmosphere."</p>

<p>In some of his experiments the limbs continued to be excitable
after eighteen hours, but with little difference in the two gases.</p>

<p>He next made several experiments, by placing the limbs of
frogs in <i>nitrogen</i> and <i>hydrogen</i>: the limbs in nitrogen lost their
irritability in about <i>two hours and a half</i>; those in hydrogen, in
about <i>four</i> hours.</p>

<p>Experiments then follow which consisted in placing other
limbs in carbonic acid and nitrous gases respectively; when he
found that in both cases the muscles ceased to act in an hour and
a half.</p>

<p>He also placed limbs in carburetted hydrogen, and found
that they ceased to act after the same period. In other experiments,
he found the correctness of Fontana's results; viz. that
limbs placed under water, and which had lost their irritability,
had for a time recovered it by exposure to air and moisture.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting of the whole series are those in
which he compared the results obtained <i>in vacuo</i> and atmospheric
air. He says: "I put one prepared limb of a frog under the
exhausted receiver of an air-pump; it lay on a plate of glass,
supported by a cup; zinc was placed beneath the thigh, and
gold under the leg; and, by means of a probe passing through
a collar of leather, I could touch both metals, so as to excite
the muscles to contraction. This I did occasionally, and found
the limb capable of excitement for twenty-two hours. The
corresponding limb, which was left exposed to the atmosphere,
also contracted at the end of that time; so that it was doubtful
which of them retained their powers in the greater degree.
The same experiment was repeated several times, with results so
nearly alike, that I am inclined to believe <i>irritability</i> continues
very little longer in common air than it does in the exhausted
receiver of an air-pump.</p>

<p>"I have frequently produced numerous contractions in the
limbs of frogs inclosed in azotic, hydrogenous, and other gases;
which likewise tend to show that the cause of irritability does
<i>not depend on oxygen</i> for its power of action."</p>

<p>He then remarks that, notwithstanding the great importance
of oxygen, he thinks it has been overrated; for, says he, "Different
tribes of animals partake of it in different degrees; and
those who have the least of it are far <i>from being the least
vivacious</i>."</p>

<p>He here reasons on premises which were then universally
admitted, and which form at present a portion of many very
questionable impressions in relation to respiration.</p>

<p>We mention one: "that fish, frogs, &amp;c., breathe less oxygen
than warm-blooded animals." But whilst, in respect to the frog,
there are many conditions relating to the skin to be considered
before we can admit this proposition, we hold it to be <i>demonstrable</i>
that fish breathe more oxygen than most other animals;
due attention not having been paid to the enormous proportion of
oxygen in the air found in water; being in fact, about, one-third.
In his concluding remarks, he says, that as regards nitrogen,
hydrogen, and carbonic acid, it only shows what we knew before:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
that they are injurious to life, and that oxygen is not more beneficial
than common air. The experiments "showing the long
continuance of life and action in muscles in an exhausted receiver,
he considers worthy of notice, as tending to show that
the cause of irritability in muscles, when once formed, does not
require the assistance of external matter."</p>

<p>Lastly, he gives an experiment on the blood (which shows
how he was working in every direction), in aid of the opinion
that the blood derives its scarlet colour from the action of oxygen.
"I took the coagulum of venous blood left in a basin after bleeding,
and, turning it bottom upwards, waited till its surface had
become of a scarlet colour. I then took slices of this surface,
and similar slices of the interior part of the coagulum, which
had a very dark appearance, and exposed them repeatedly to
azotic and nitrous gases. The scarlet colour gradually faded
upon such exposure; and the azotic gas being afterwards examined,
was found to contain oxygen, while nitrous gas was much
diminished, doubtless by combining with the same principle.
The gases to which the dark-coloured blood was exposed underwent
no change in this experiment. That blood takes oxygen
from the air, when it becomes florid, will not, I suppose, be
denied, and the experiment I have related shows that it will
again part with it, though slowly, without <i>any alteration in its
temperature</i>."</p>

<p>The principal interest, as we think, of this paper on "Irritability,"
is the evidence it affords of his determination to keep
his mind free from preconceived notions on a subject which was at
that time calculated to mislead him; especially as he then participated
in the general impression that the Oxygen was "the
great source of animal heat;" a view which he afterwards, and as
we think for excellent reasons, mistrusted.</p>

<p>This view has been revived, but, as far as we know, in no
very philosophical spirit. Whilst we would respect the opinions
of men, we can only reason on the paramount authority of nature;
and we see increasing ground to believe that he who would leave
out of physiological inquiries so large a portion of the necessary
induction as the phenomena of disease, no matter what be his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
authority, will only add to the number of those who have shown
that, the moment we neglect the most comprehensive search for
facts of which our knowledge admits, we fall into error. Mr.
Hunter has recorded his opinion of the impossibility of obtaining
a knowledge of functions without considering the phenomena
of disease; and all experience hitherto has tended to give this
observation the validity of an axiom.</p>

<p>In the foregoing experiments, the reader will have observed
the significant words, "having killed a frog"&mdash;Abernethy not
approving of experiments on living animals. When we reflect
for a moment on the thousands of dreadful experiments which
have been made on living animals, and the utter inconclusiveness
of them for any useful purpose, there are, amongst the numerous
errors by which so many philosophical inquiries have been delayed
or defeated, few that are more lamentable.</p>

<p>This mode of investigation has not, so far as we can see, produced
<i>any one useful discovery</i>; whilst it has tended to obscure,
by all that is disgusting and repulsive, the true mode of cultivating
a most alluring science.</p>

<p>But as we write, however humbly, as physiologists, and may
be regarded as advocating the claims and attractions of that
science with something of the <i>esprit de métier</i>, rather than in the
cautious spirit which should characterize a philosophical discussion,&mdash;let
us for one moment consider the claims of physiology on
the attention of mankind.</p>

<p>Physiology has for its object the investigation of the functions
and relations of the whole organic kingdom (the vegetable and
animal creation), and cannot be successfully cultivated without
consulting the phenomena in both these kingdoms of nature.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>The branch of physiology most interesting to the medical
philosopher is that which deals with the functions of animals in
general, and of man in particular. The special interest to the
medical philosopher is therefore obvious: let us just glance at its
more general claims. Linnæus said that the world was one vast
museum; and it illustrates the nature and attributes of the
Deity.</p>

<p>But how? In the first place, by the numerous evidences it
<i>everywhere</i> presents, even to our finite capacities, of design, wisdom,
and power; and further, of the Unity of that power. But,
to our finite perceptions, it does not <i>everywhere</i> present evidences
of love, mercy, and parental care. Not because they may not
exist universally, but because our faculties do not allow us to
connect these ideas with any but "sentient beings."</p>

<p>This alone renders physiology one of the most elevating of all
human studies&mdash;most general in its application&mdash;most comprehensive
in the attributes it unfolds to us, and therefore most
refining to our moral nature.</p>

<p>Although, therefore, we would claim the <i>special</i> theological
evidences of physiology, as the distinguishing excellence of this
science, it is not less commanding as regard the evidences which
it affords in <i>common</i> with other parts of the Creation.</p>

<p>In animals, we see not less indications of design, wisdom,
power, and beauty, than elsewhere; but we <i>also</i> see a provision
for their wants and comforts, of such a kind as leaves no room
for doubting that both have been the objects of design. We
need not here go into the multiplied proofs of this proposition.
<i>A priori</i>, then, it would seem very unlikely that a mode of investigating
the functions of animals would be productive, which
begins by ignoring one of their most striking relations.</p>

<p>This, too, at once suggests the moral question, Is it right?
There is no necessity, for our present purpose, to moot that
question. We have, over and over again, challenged investigation;
but the case is too clear to admit of discussion. Again,
although we humbly submit that the moral bearing of philosophical
questions must always be a legitimate subject of inquiry,
yet it is inexpedient to introduce that question where it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
required. The questions whether the progress of physiology has
been <i>accelerated</i> by experiments on living animals, or whether
the <i>treatment of diseases</i> has been improved by that mode of
inquiry, or whether it has <i>tended to mislead people</i> into erroneous
and mischievous views, are all things that admit of proof entirely
independent of moral considerations. Now we should be sorry
to appear to undervalue that which we most highly prize, or to
represent that to be irrelevant which is, in all subjects, the great
consideration; but it is wise to take the ground chosen by those
who argue in support of a fallacy; not that which they would
ignore, or regard as disputable.</p>

<p>As we have already observed, we think it demonstrable that
experiments on living animals, <i>involving cruelty</i>, have been entirely
unproductive, whilst they have tended to mislead more than
any other mode of investigation whatever. Many years since,
we corrected some very extraordinary mis-statements in regard
to the experiments of Orfila, Sir Charles Bell, and others, which
could only be accounted for by a want of attention to the works
from which they were selected; for it is curious to observe that
(though different in kind) the most conclusive evidence of the
erroneous value attributed to the experiments is furnished by the
distinguished authors themselves.</p>

<p>Orfila wished to know what would be the effect of various
poisons on the animal economy. He therefore set to work as
follows:&mdash;He opened the gullet of a living animal, put in the
poison, and then tied the tube; and this to ascertain how the
stomach dealt with substances of this kind taken into that organ.
Now there have been, unfortunately, too many instances afforded,
by accidents and by suicides, of these very things in the human
subject; presenting us with a series of facts, deplorable enough,
it is true, but which, regarded merely as grounds of philosophical
inquiry, are comparatively free from objection; whilst the experiments
made by Orfila on his tortured animals are obviously
loaded with all the elements of fallacy. It is surely not necessary
to urge, as one of these, so serious a preliminary as placing
a ligature on the gullet. We say nothing of the horrible cries
that Orfila describes these animals as uttering; but surely, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
object had been to interfere with and obscure the processes
of nature by every conceivable ingenuity, one could not have
imagined any conditions better calculated for this purpose.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Bell was a physiologist who distinguished himself
by a really important discovery; and it has been cited as an example
of the successful application of the mode of inquiry in
question. This is entirely an error. Whoever will read his book,
will at once perceive the truth of that which he himself judiciously
observes; namely, that physiology is much more a science of observation
than experiment. As to the influence of experiments
on animals, in his own discoveries, we have the best possible
authority for denying it; viz. Sir Charles Bell himself. He states
very clearly the object with which he was <i>reluctantly</i> induced to
make some experiments. They had, in fact, nothing to do with
his <i>discovery</i>. They were made in reluctant concession to the
slowly-paced perceptions of others.</p>

<p>This he had the manliness to acknowledge, and the benevolence
to regret. In short, examine what series of such experiments
we may, we always find them either wholly unproductive,
or, if they appear to prove anything of value, it is always something
that is much more <i>logically</i> deducible from sources altogether
unobjectionable. But if this be so, is there no mischief
in unproductive modes of inquiry? Again&mdash;putting aside the
brutalizing tendency of such practices as part of the moral question&mdash;Is
life so long? Is Science so easy? Is Physiology, and
especially the deplorably halt condition of Medical Science, in
such a state that we can afford to waste time in <i>vicious modes</i> of
inquiry? We think not. Is there nothing mischievous in our
endeavour to obtain by the evidence of sense (the eye) that insight
into nature which Lord Bacon has so emphatically warned us is
the office of higher&mdash;in fact, of our intellectual&mdash;perceptions? If
we are not allowed to indulge in feelings of disgust and abhorrence
at all that is revolting to common sense, and our best and
kindliest sentiments, can we read, without distrust, of experiments
which so disgust by their nature that we know not how to describe
them; or which are so revolting, from their cruelty, that
the mind recoils from the contemplation of them? Is it possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
to read many of the experiments of Spallanzani<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor"><sup>24</sup></a>, without feeling
the same disgust that Abernethy used to express in regard to
them; or to read of opening animals alive, dividing them with
instruments, breaking their bones, or running red-hot wires into
their cavities, without feeling (if, indeed, any thing better is to
be regarded as merely "mawkish sentimentality") that at least
valuable time has been wasted in pursuits which have been brutalizing
and unproductive?</p>

<p>In a review of a Biography of Sir Astley Cooper, in the
"Quarterly," an experiment there described was characterized by
the writer as "Hellish." We have no desire whatever to use
unnecessarily strong terms; nor do we think that the one above
mentioned was too strong for the case to which it referred; but
we think that this extremely fallacious mode of investigation will
be most quickly abandoned, by meeting fairly and in a mild and
moderate spirit any allegations in its favour. Dr. Hull, of Norwich,
and several other eminent persons, have expressed their
dissent from this mode of inquiry.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton considered cruelty to animals a violation of
Christian charity<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor"><sup>25</sup></a>.</p>

<p>For our part, we have several times stated <i>our willingness to
discuss</i> any class of experiments which may be selected; for,
although we may not express ourselves so well as a late writer in
the "Quarterly," yet to our minds heaven and hell do not present
an idea of greater contrast than that afforded by the notion&mdash;that
laws which govern the whole animal kingdom, and which
present, at every moment, accumulating evidences of goodness
and mercy, should be auspiciously sought, much less have their
nature and relations developed, by torture of those very objects
for whom such benevolent provisions have been designed. We
have paid some attention to this subject; and it is very curious
to remark, that observations or experiments, when they cease to
be cruel, become instructive.</p>

<p>Indeed, if we reflect for a moment, we shall see that it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
be so. If we desire to know the actual nature of any living
being, it must be as if we were ourselves unseen&mdash;that is, that
the animal may be in a <i>perfectly</i> undisturbed condition. The
moment we <i>lose</i> this, elements of interference immediately arise
and fog our reasoning; and the more refined the inquiry, the
more the avoidance of disturbance becomes essential: in fact, the
utmost success in obtaining the conditions <i>philosophically</i> necessary,
depends on maintaining as nearly as possible the natural
condition&mdash;that is, the comfort of the animal; so that the conditions
necessary on philosophical grounds, and those which we
regard as still more important after all, coincide.</p>

<p>In every path of life, there are unpleasant duties; and it
might have happened that the functions of animals could only
have been investigated by the means we would repudiate: but
the simple truth is, that it is demonstrably otherwise.</p>

<p>Abernethy had a decided objection to experiments involving
cruelty. He never made any himself that could fairly be so
called; and he never alludes to the subject without some remark
tending to show his disapproval of them. Nor is it, in our view,
any disparagement that his benevolent feelings were largely influential
in governing his opinions on this subject. He began
his researches, with the ability and inclination to investigate Life
under every phase, at a time when no one had begun, so far as
we know, to question this mode of investigation. But, whilst he
left no other untried, he only recognized experimenting on living
animals so far as to show that his benevolence could be sufficiently
discriminative to select experiments where the existence of suffering
was doubtful, and that the doubt alone was sufficient to induce
him to abandon the pursuit.</p>

<p>We are sorry to dismiss a subject of so great importance, both
in a moral and physiological point of view, with what we feel to
be so meagre a discussion. But it would require more than our
whole space to examine the many thousand torturing experiments,
and expose the uselessness and <i>fallacies</i> which they exemplify.
We have elsewhere discussed the subject somewhat more at large<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor"><sup>26</sup></a>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
here we have only the opportunity of just touching on it. The
greatest respect we can pay the memory of a great man, is to apply
carefully any principles which he may have left sufficiently matured
for practical purposes; and so to treat those of which he
may have only <i>given us hints, or elementary suggestions</i><a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor"><sup>27</sup></a>, as shall
most searchingly examine their nature and claims to further development
and cultivation. If every opportunity is not sufficient
to do this in full, we must comfort ourselves with the hope that,
where there is not ability to produce conviction, there may appear
sincerity of purpose sufficient to suggest what is even more valuable,
"patient inquiry."</p>

<p>This is a duty we owe to every subject on which we venture
to form any opinion, either in the study or the practice of our
profession; and we have the utmost confidence that the scientific
investigation and the moral argument will be found to coincide.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>In our brief sketches of Abernethy's works, we are quite as
desirous of showing why he did not do more, as we are of
setting down faithfully our many undoubted obligations to him.
This, indeed, is the best mode of giving an onward impulse
to those approaches towards a definite science which (John
Hunter excepted) he was the first to secure. If we would increase
the usefulness of those beautiful principles which he has
left us, we can hardly do better than endeavour to point out any
error or deficiency in the investigation of any subjects to which
such principles may be applicable. His work on "Tumours"
contains much that is interesting in regard to the peculiar character
of his mind, and his aptitude for simplification. He does
not undertake a thorough investigation of the subject. His
object seems to have been to place in an intelligible order, to
chronicle and mark, that which was <i>really</i> known; to pack together,
as it were, that which was clear and positive, in a form
convenient for consideration; to remove that disorder and obscurity
which seem to hang about the threshold of all inquiries,
and substitute so much of arrangement and perspicuity as might
invite, and perhaps facilitate, further investigation.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>He states the more important circumstances which he had
observed, and conducts his classification of the so-called "Tumours"
on a basis as scientific as it could be on an imperfect induction of
facts. He did this in a way eminently characteristic of his quick
perception, in seizing those properties on which a nomenclature
should be based, and in marking those distinctions which, in a
practical science, must always be regarded as of the greatest
value. He founded his nomenclature chiefly on certain resemblances,
observed in these diseases, to well-known structures
of the body.</p>

<p>The simplicity of this plan, so long as the resemblance is
obvious, is just that which constitutes excellence in nomenclature.
To take an example, amongst others, he says there is a tumour
the structure of which resembles the Pancreas, or Sweetbread as
it is popularly called, and to this tumour he gives the name of
Pancreatic. Now every one knows a sweetbread, and the name
implies no opinion whatever as to its nature; it simply declares
a fact. Whatever we may ultimately discover with regard to
tumours, a name of this kind, though it may possibly be exchanged
for one more significant of the nature of the disease, will
still leave us nothing to unlearn; for the tumour in question will
always have that resemblance from which Mr. Abernethy named
it; and if we should find (as indeed we do find), in course of
time, that diseases undergo alterations of type, the rarity of a
tumour resembling the sweetbread would record that circumstance.</p>

<p>Had he examined them by the microscope, and selected the
appearances so elicited as grounds for his classification, it would
have been much less useful. In the first place, comparatively
few persons would have had the opportunity or taken the pains to
<i>observe</i>; and secondly, we should have had the inconveniences
resulting from that variety which we generally find in the reports
of microscopic researches. There is just now a great disposition
for microscopic inquiry, perhaps somewhat too much; but no
channel should be neglected, if it be not too exclusively relied on.
Abernethy amused himself at one period in examining ultimate
structure by the microscope; but he seems to have had but a very
measured reliance on this mode of investigation.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>Judicious nomenclature is of immense importance in the
framework of science, and a want of care in this has probably
done as much as anything to impede the course of rational investigation.
There is nothing, perhaps, in the whole range of
science more to be lamented than many&mdash;indeed, I might say all&mdash;parts
of medical nomenclature. If our ignorance prevents us
from giving a name to a thing which is descriptive of its nature,
we might easily avoid applying such as are calculated to mislead.
We can imagine the confusion which would result from a druggist
labelling a bottle of water, "poison;" and a vessel containing
poison, "water;" yet we doubt whether he would more imperfectly
express the true relations of these fluids, than the terms "fever"
and "inflammation" do the real nature of the conditions which
they are employed to designate.</p>

<p>Abernethy's arrangement of tumours not only illustrates his
disposition to seize on the more salient points of a subject, but
also his inclination to seek for the essential relations of (so-called
local) disease in the general condition of the body. He consistently,
therefore, mentions them in an order founded on such
relations. He places those first which he had found least dangerous
in their nature, least destructive in their effects, and which
appeared to him to have been attended by the least disturbance
to the general economy. In like manner he placed those which
had manifested more malignant or dangerous characters, in the
order of their severity; inferring their characters respectively
from the disturbance of the constitution, the resistance of the
disease to treatment, and the variety of structures destroyed in its
progress.</p>

<p>Between these two extremes, he placed, as the step of transition,
that tumour which he had observed to partake most strongly
of intermediate characters. But, besides the desire to throw some
light on the subject of tumours generally, he had another special
object in view. Few diseases exemplify the absence of scientific
research more than tumours. In regard to most of these morbid
depositions, it may be remarked that, even now, whenever a
patient with one of these so-called tumours applies for advice, the
practicability of removal is too often the only thing thought of;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
and it must be obvious to common sense that the mere cutting
away of a deposition of this kind (however proper under some
peculiar circumstances), can hardly ever exert any influence on the
causes of its production. Indeed the manner in which these
diseases are continually removed, without any previous inquiry
that is really worthy of the name, is amongst the many grounds
on which we found the opinion expressed in the sequel on the
present state of medical surgery, as contrasted with that in which
it was left by Abernethy. Now, while the gravity of the subject
rendered the consideration of all tumours important, there was
one which in an especial manner had eluded all efforts to expose
its nature and dependencies&mdash;this was the justly-dreaded cancer.
In regard to this, Mr. Abernethy hoped that further information
might be obtained, by investigating other tumours more closely,
and thus bringing, as he expresses it, collateral knowledge to bear
on it, "like light shining from various places to illustrate the
object of our researches."</p>

<p>Here was a suggestion in the true spirit of philosophical inquiry;
whilst, in taking so simple a basis for the names of
tumours, and then associating them in arrangement with their
respective constitutional tendencies, he adopted the best mode of
recording in a general sense their more important relations. But
the fault lay in the suppressed premise that the <i>relations</i> of the
so-called tumours were comprehended by a division which is not
founded in nature. Nothing indeed can be more artificial than
that division of diseases to which surgeons usually restrict the
term tumour; a defect which besets all medical inquiries. The
old division, in which all sorts of diseases were jumbled together
under the general name of tumours, defective as it might be, was
much more auspicious, had it ever been made the object of a really
philosophical inquiry; because the very diversity of the phenomena
they presented would, by the ordinary process of common
sense or inductive reasoning, have only served to bring out their
common characters&mdash;the most important first step in all investigations
of this nature.</p>

<p>Had Mr. Abernethy extended that collateral view which he
justly insists on, to <i>all sorts of new depositions</i>, instead of confining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
it to the so-called "tumours," he would have detected how
artificial was the division, and taken it at its just value; he would
have found that he had excluded circumstances which not only
led to a much more intimate knowledge of the relations on which
those so-called tumours depend, but which confer a power of
demonstrating easily, and in a more particular manner, to the
most ignorant or prejudiced, those relations to a disordered state
of the body, of which, without such assistance, it required a mind
no less penetrative and suggestive than Abernethy's to give even
a general enunciation. This defect essentially consisted in the
vice we have before alluded to, and is nothing else but a violation
of one of the rules most insisted on by Lord Bacon<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor"><sup>28</sup></a>.</p>

<p>It proceeds, perhaps, from the habit of looking at subjects
through a medium too exclusively anatomical, and by which even
Mr. Hunter was sometimes, though exceptionally, hampered.
Popularly, it was deducing conclusions from only a portion of the
facts of the subject; but if Abernethy did not get the whole of
the facts, and therefore missed some portion of the conclusions to
be drawn from them, he at least avoided the error of inferring
anything positive which the facts did not warrant. We hope,
however, that the paper has been valuable, in enabling some of us
to arrive at further views, which serve to confirm the truth and
extend the application of those entertained by Abernethy.</p>

<p>Now, to put the whole thing popularly, and to direct the public
view to the common sense of the matter, it is obvious that if
we want to know the real nature of any growth whatever&mdash;say a
tumour, a plant, or an animal&mdash;we cannot do this by any examination
of its structure <i>alone</i>. If we desire to know its nature,
we must also examine its habits, food, climate, and the various
influences to which it is subjected. If, indeed, this were once
done, then it is very possible, on again seeing the structure <i>merely</i>,
we might recognize its real relations, although we might still be
glad to have any well-known substance to which we could compare
it, if only to <i>record</i> its identity. This is right enough, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
to <i>obtain</i> the general knowledge before we <i>assume</i> the particular.
Again, suppose I had some ground growing all manner of plants,
and twenty different sorts of fungi, what should I get by <i>merely</i>
examining the fibres of one or the other?</p>

<p>But I should easily discover that some plants grew best in one
soil, some in another, some with more moisture, some with less;
whilst the very circumstances of soil, moisture, and so on, which
were essential to some, might be enfeebling or destructive to others.
No one will for a moment doubt that the kind of nutrition was
of great importance in all, and this would necessarily lead me to
infer that, "If I desired to get such a fungus, I must have more
moisture, less air, less heat or light, or another soil," and so on.</p>

<p>In a plant, you must also look to the roots and other parts of
the organism. Now this is exactly what should be done in regard
to tumours; and for no reason more cogent than that the great
beauty and beneficent effects of Mr. Abernethy's views may become
practically useful; for in the same manner that we would desire to
influence the plant or the fungus through the sources whence it
derives its nourishment, as air, water, various ingredients in the
earth, and so on; so the only channels by which <i>we</i> can effect
any influence, are those organs by which these matters are ultimately
changed into the structures we wish to maintain, or we
desire to get rid of, as the case may be. Now, although the
number and relations of these organs may render the investigation
more difficult in one case than in another, as they become
more multiplied, or as the animal or vegetable is more or less
simple or complicated in structure; yet, whether we take our example
from man, or any other animal&mdash;or, in fact, any organized
being of the countless modifications we find in nature&mdash;the instrumentality
through which the vital power acts is neither more
nor less than the assimilating organs.</p>

<p>If we have been too professional in this discussion, we plead,
as an apology, that in no one point in the whole range of surgical
practice would unnecessary suffering be avoided more frequently
than on the subject before us; provided only that what is clear
and positive, as distinguished from what is conventional and erroneous,
were once popularly familiar; for, amongst other evils,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
most of the operations in this department of surgery are not only
superfluous&mdash;to use no stronger term&mdash;but they practically <i>interfere
more than any one thing whatever</i> with the progress of the
scientific investigation of the nature of these maladies.</p>

<p>The removal of them by operation is too commonly undertaken,
not only under circumstances which, as Abernethy said,
"add cruelty to calamity," but for reasons which logically forbid
such a proceeding; and although there are conditions which call
for such interference, yet those under which it is usually instituted
help only to obscure the real relations of the disease, and
to throw the shadowy veil of an irrational empiricism over the
operations of nature.</p>

<p>Those who recollect the remarkable results which Abernethy
sometimes obtained in regard to this intractable and often formidable
class of diseases, will, I think, be disposed to agree in thinking
that few maladies are more open to improved investigation,
or promise a more encouraging prospect of enlarging the boundaries
of philosophical medicine.</p>

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">SECTION.</p>

<p class="center bold in0 p1t p1b">HIS PAPER ON A CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE SOMETIMES<br />
FOLLOWING INJURY TO THE LUNGS.</p>

<p>Fractured ribs are common accidents, and illustrate very
beautifully those conservative principles in animal bodies which
give such interest to the study of their economy.</p>

<p>When first we consider that the ribs form the greater part of
that box in which the lungs and heart are enclosed, and by which
they are protected, we are disposed to regard a fracture of one or
more ribs as a very serious affair.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, these accidents generally do extremely well. In
the first place, the gristles, or cartilages as they are called, by
which the ribs are attached to the sternum in front, give, in conjunction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
with the spine behind, considerable elasticity to the whole
structure of the chest. Most injuries have therefore to overcome
this elasticity, before anything gives way; and when the rib has
done so, and is fractured, the resiliency of the cartilage or gristle
to which it is attached <i>tends</i> to restore it to its place, or to set it,
as we phrase it.</p>

<p>Another very curious thing in accidents is the instantaneity
with which muscles which are <i>ordinarily</i> under the dominion of
the will, become reluctant to obey it, or altogether repudiate its
authority. In all fractures, of course, the most material thing is
absolute repose; and there is very little chance of a man moving
his rib when it is broken. He instinctively begins to expand his
chest, for the admission of the necessary air, by other muscles,
usually to the exclusion of those which are attached to the broken
bone.</p>

<p>The Lung, which may be considered as a series of tubes,
some conveying blood, and others air, is often wounded; but the
blood immediately stops the leak, from its tendency to coagulate
when out of the vessels; and no harm ensues. Occasionally,
however, a circumstance occurs, which, until it is understood,
appears curious and alarming. Either from the extent, the
scratching of the surface, or some other peculiarity in the wound
of the lung, the air escapes from it, and the patient is as it were
blown up, as to the chest, neck, and face, by the air impelled
from the lung beneath the skin into the connecting tissue, exactly
in the same manner as the butcher does when he is preparing
veal. This blowing-up is called, from the Greek word for it,
<i>Emphysema</i>; and it was on this feature in these accidents that
Mr. Abernethy wrote a short paper.</p>

<p>There is not much which is absolutely new in it. It is chiefly
remarkable for the clear manner in which it places before us what
is required, as distinguished from what is officious and unnecessary,
and, in fact, reduces the treatment to that of ordinary cases,
with one clearly defined modification.</p>

<p>He shows his familiarity with Pneumatics, so far as they are
touched by the case, just as he does his knowledge of Chemistry
elsewhere. The exceptional cases, in which the air is confined in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
the chest, the mode of procuring it an exit by operation, and the
condition regulating this proceeding, are very simply and clearly
laid down.</p>

<p>The paper also contains remarks on the collapse of the lungs
when the chest is opened, and on certain exceptions which have
been observed, which, from their general interest and suggestive
character, will well repay an attentive perusal.</p>

<p>He next offers a few remarks on those mothers' marks, as
they are popularly called, and which are technically styled nævi.
They are generally little more than clusters of enlarged blood-vessels,
and are usually removed by excision or other operative
proceedings. As the essential character of these marks is increased
action and size of vessels, Mr. Abernethy thought that, if
well-regulated pressure were made on them so as to impede the
flow of blood into them, and this were conjoined with Cold (which
represses vascular action), many of them might be got rid of
in this manner. He found his idea realized, and published
three cases of its success. The value of these suggestions consists,
first, in the opposition they offer, <i>pro tanto</i>, to that absurd
tendency there is to remove everything like a tumour; and the
impediment thence arising to any searching inquiry into the causes
on which they depend.</p>

<p>But there is another inconvenience which occasionally renders
the excision of these nævi very inadvisable. It sometimes happens
that they are so situated that they cannot be removed,
without making the disfigurement greater, or from some other
still more serious objection; as, for example, when small ones
occur in the face, or when they are placed near the eye. Under
such circumstances, the contraction consequent on a wound of
any extent is a serious inconvenience; in some of these cases, the
adoption of Mr. Abernethy's plan allows us to dispense with
the operation by excision, as I have myself experienced. As it
illustrates the advantage of the plan in a case where it was particularly
applicable, I will briefly refer to one example. A young
lady had one of these marks at the root of the nose, where, from
the position, as well as from the contiguity of the eyes, any
dragging from the contraction of a scar, would have been particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
undesirable. She was brought from the country to have
it removed; but, on representing the objections to that course, it
was agreed to try Mr. Abernethy's plan, which was completely
successful.</p>

<p>At this period, Mr. Abernethy published sundry other interesting
papers, showing, in his observations of all that was passing
around him, that his views were not less circumspect and comprehensive
than they were clear. His "surgical cases" are all
excellent; and if they do not contain so full an account (the
great vice of medical records) of all the circumstances which
preceded them, as are sufficient to furnish future investigators
with the elements of accurate generalization, they are remarkably
valuable for the qualities of clearness and candour.</p>

<p>We may have an opportunity of briefly alluding to some of
these papers in our summary; but they are hardly practicable
subjects for popular analysis, although they form some of the
most valuable contributions to the practical literature of the profession.
They show also that he was as penetrative and efficient
in regard to the operative department of practice, as he was in
those higher and more extended views, which, in enlarging the
<i>science</i> of surgery, has tended to diminish, of course, the number
of operations.</p>

<p>About the year 1785, John Hunter had invented his celebrated
improvement in the treatment of a disease of the arteries
called "Aneurism." It was a very simple deduction from observations
on the state of the arteries; and although it was one of
those inquiries which had been made the subject of experiments
on living animals, it was one on which <i>not the smallest light</i>
had been thrown by such investigations.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunter had found that, in addition to many other serious
objections to an operation which had been usually performed for
the relief of this disease&mdash;which consists either of a giving way
of a <i>portion</i>, or a general enlargement, of a vessel (for it is
sometimes one, sometimes the other)&mdash;a great cause of failure
had been, that the ligature which was placed round the
artery was too near the disease, and, in fact, involved a portion
of the tube which was unsound. He accordingly proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
tying the artery a little farther off, and thus substituted, for
an operation which was extremely severe, very hazardous, and
too commonly fatal, a comparatively short and simple proceeding,
which, under <i>moderately favourable auspices</i>, is almost uniformly
successful.</p>

<p>As with many other discoveries, accident and similarity of views
had suggested similar proceedings to others, so that continental
surgeons were disposed to dispute the merit of the discovery in
favour of Guillemeau, Guattani, Anel, Desault, &amp;c., as their views
favoured one or other; but there can be no doubt that for
the first clear exposition of the <i>principles</i> of the operation, as
well as of the objects it was designed to accomplish, we are indebted
to John Hunter.</p>

<p>John Hunter's operation applied to the main artery supplying
the lower extremity, and surgeons have since extended the proceeding
to many other arteries. The first extension of it, however,
occurred to Mr. Abernethy, who, about this time (1797),
placed a ligature on what is called the external iliac artery; and
as he seldom touched anything which he did not improve, he
made an important modification in the mode of proceeding.</p>

<p>Subsequent experience, it is true, has, in some measure,
rendered that improvement no longer necessary; yet, whenever
circumstances arise which lead to any material disturbance of the
artery from its situation, we apprehend the caution of Abernethy
in tying it in two places close to its connection with the surrounding
parts, is a valuable condition.</p>

<p>He also sent, about this time, an ingenious paper to the Royal
Society, on certain small openings into the cavities of the heart.
They are called the "Foramina of Thebesius," from an anatomist
who particularly described them. This is to us one of the prettiest
of his physiological contributions. The facts are stated
with great simplicity, their relations to disease beautifully pointed
out, and the inference from the whole very striking, as being in
harmony with the facts whence it is deduced. Abernethy's idea
being, that the holes were for the purpose of obviating excessive
repletion of the nutrient vessels of the heart, by allowing them
to relieve themselves by pouring a portion of their blood through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
these holes into the general mass of the circulation. It could
hardly, however, be made interesting to the general reader without
going into the subject more than is suited to our present object.</p>

<p>In 1799, Abernethy's reputation had gone on rapidly increasing.
His numerous pupils, too, had become the media for frequent
consultations, in addition to those which arose from his
own connection, and his reputation with the public.</p>

<p>He now moved from St. Mildred's Court, and took the house
in Bedford Row. This was some time previous to October, 1799,
the September of that year being the last time his name appears
on the rate-book of St. Mildred's Court. He never again changed
his professional residence. The move was an important step, but
it was only the precursor to one still more interesting.</p>

<p>In the January of the following year, an event occurred which
seldom fails to exert a greater influence on a man's future prospects
and happiness than any other. This was no less than his
marriage&mdash;of which we must say a few words in a separate
chapter.</p>

<p>There are few subjects on which people are more agreed
than the value of "good matches;" neither do they seem to differ
very widely as to what that phrase is intended to convey. Not
that everybody's <i>beau-idéal</i> implies identity of composition, but
they are pretty well agreed as to the more essential elements.</p>

<p>But if we observe the different ways by which people seek to
obtain a common object, we are puzzled to know how folks that
set out in such various directions should ever arrive at the same
point. The travellers are said, too, to provide themselves not
unfrequently with various disguises; not only in dress and externals,
but even in manners and sentiments, which they do not
usually entertain. Thus we have heard of one who professed a
great love of music, who scarcely had an idea of melody; of
another who expressed an admiration of poets whom he had never
read, or voted unmitigated bores. Others have been known to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
avow a perfect indifference to wealth, who have had scarcely an
idea unmixed with an instinctive admiration of the <i>æs in presenti</i>.</p>

<p>We once heard a curious fellow say that he could marry any
lady he liked, if he could only "bring himself to take the trouble;"
and we thought how happy he would be if he could live on as
good terms with his wife as he appeared to be on with himself.
Some start with an apothegm which they carry about like an
amulet or charm; such as, "No greater rogue than he who marries
only for money, and no greater fool than he who marries only
for love." Apothegms, however, like many things in this
world&mdash;Macintoshes and umbrellas inclusive&mdash;are very apt to be
left at home when most wanted.</p>

<p>We are not informed whether table-turning or mesmerism
have yet discovered any prophylactics against the undoubted perils
of an expedition in search of a partner.</p>

<p>We are unfortunately not sufficiently versed in these mysteries
to know the "latest accounts;" but from the reputed effects of
platinum and other metals, we should not be surprised to hear
that a person well mesmerised would be found very clairvoyant of
gold. We are not aware of the achievements necessary to arrive
at the exalted position of "a Professor;" but it is said that "Professors"
find gold without the necessity of going to the "diggings."</p>

<p>Table-turning, we hear, has not as yet been found successful.
By shooting too much ahead of the slowly moving current of
human affairs, it skipped over one generation, and thus recently
entrapped an Irish gentleman of the "highest respectability" by
giving a fortune to a lady too soon; it happening to be found
still in possession of its "right owner"&mdash;or, as the technical
phrase is, "in expectation."</p>

<p>Many aspirants for wedlock have sundry misgivings about
certain traditionary repulsions which are said to exist between love
and poverty, and, uninfluenced by the charms of matrimony, think
only of the possible consequences. Not a few, however, regard
marriage as too serious an affair for sport or speculation. They
think it very difficult for mortals who know so little of themselves
to know much about other people, and that though matches
in rank and money are daily seen to be very practicable, yet that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
matches in mind are still as difficult as Dryden represented them&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">

<div class="i0">Though pair'd in Heaven, in Paradise were curs'd."</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>People of this sort contemplate marriage in a very unpoetical
manner. They have great faith that correct intention and common
sense are the best guides; and, although they may not feel
less transported with their prospects than other people, they are
apt to remember that it is "transportation for life."</p>

<p>A great deal has been said of the marriage of Abernethy, and
very much of it in proof of his eccentricity of character; but
if a steady reliance on earnestness, sincerity, and common sense,
on an occasion on which one or other of these qualities are
sometimes laid aside, and the employment of the highest
qualities of the mind for the most important purposes be wise,
we must, if we admit the eccentricity of Abernethy, concede to
him the less-equivocal merit of practical wisdom. Himself a
sensible and clever man, and a great admirer of these qualifications
in others, he was not very likely to ally himself to any lady
who appeared deficient in such characteristics.</p>

<p>Abernethy had a very quick perception of character, and his
profession afforded him ample opportunities for the exercise and
the cultivation of this faculty. He would not have been very
likely to lay it aside on an occasion when a judicious and successful
exercise of it, as distinguished from mere impulse or first
impression, is of more consequence than on almost any other.</p>

<p>Miss Anne Threlfall was the daughter of a gentleman who
had retired from business, and who it appears had been residing
in the town of the far-famed Edmonton. This lady was intimate
with the family of Mr. Hodgson, where Abernethy was also a
frequent visitor.</p>

<p>It was at Mr. Hodgson's that Mr. Abernethy first made the
acquaintance of her who was destined to exert so considerable an
influence on his future happiness.</p>

<p>In the unrestrained intercourse of the society of intimate
mutual friends, a man of Abernethy's penetration would not be
long in discovering the amiable or the estimable qualities of an
agreeable woman.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Abernethy added to personal attractions of no common
order, great good sense, and a very lively, ladylike manner. These
had not been without their influence, on their first meeting; and
a few additional interviews, which the usual precursor of an undefinable
pleasure in her society served to accelerate, not only confirmed
his first impressions, but seem to have deepened them into
sentiments of warm respect and affection. Now, supposing his
opinion formed, his resolution taken, there was still a difficulty&mdash;Abernethy
was remarkably shy, and extremely sensitive.</p>

<p>His whole time was absorbed in teaching, studying, and practising
his profession; his rising ambition just getting success
within its grasp. How was resolution or opportunity to be found
for the tardigrade, time-consuming process of a regular siege?
Still, after all, the shyness was the real Rubicon which he felt a
difficulty in passing. Common Sense said to a sensitive Conscience,
"You are about to ask a lady to entrust to you her happiness
for life." "Ah!" said Conscience, "that is indeed a
great deal to ask of any one." And Shyness said it was equally
difficult to know what to say, how to make the request, or brook
a refusal. The difficulty with Abernethy was so great, that there
is some reason to doubt whether he could have got over it, had
he been left entirely to his own resources.</p>

<p>Mr. Hodgson, it seems, did not sympathize with Abernethy's
scruples and difficulties, but simply encouraged him to overcome
them. It is wonderful how even the greatest minds are influenced
sometimes by a timely "pat on the back." We recollect a distinguished
public man, and a peculiarly single-minded one too,
once observing, that few people had any idea of the comfort which
public men sometimes derived from any one, whom they imagined
sincere, simply saying, "You were quite right, I think." Whatever
Abernethy might, or might not, have owed to some little
help of this kind, it is quite certain that he at last opened his
heart to Miss Threlfall, or at least essayed so to do; but, apparently
not very well assured that he had said what he intended
<i>to say</i>, he supported it by a letter, which proved successful.</p>

<p>This letter is still extant, and an interesting document it is.
It forms a curious commentary on the numerous and dissimilar
versions which have been given of it by gossip; all the versions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
we ever heard having had the common character of being in every
respect entirely unlike the original. Here it is:</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="sigright in0">"Tuesday.</p>

<p>"I have felt extremely anxious, dearest Lady, since I had the
pleasure to be with you, lest, from my embarrassment in delivering
my sentiments, I might have said any thing liable to misapprehension.
This anxiety induces me to trouble you with
the present letter. I had designed, in our last conversation, to
have said, that I had ever regarded the marriage state as that
of the greatest happiness. It always appeared to me that two
persons of different sexes living together in reciprocal benevolence
were placed at the summit of human felicity. Hard necessity
has, however, precluded me from the enjoyment of such
bliss; and when I had at length relinquished even the idea of
it, by accident I met with a lady in whom were concentred all
the qualities which I could have wished for in the moments of
fondest expectation, and from whom I was led to believe I
might derive what I had ever regarded as the greatest happiness.
This was to me one of those circumstances of the reality of
which the mind seems doubtful, from the excess of delight that
it occasions. I had wished, dearest Lady, at our last interview,
to have convinced you that I was capable of discerning
and loving you, as well for the perfections of your mind, as for
the charms of your person. I have ever been an enthusiastic
admirer of intellectual excellence; and in the minds of some
ladies whom I have known, I have distinguished a purity of
thought and benevolence of design which I have never found,
nor can I expect to find, amongst men. In addition to these
simple and fascinating qualities, I have witnessed a clearness of
perception and judgment, an undeviating rectitude of principle,
and, as the result of these and other qualities, such a dignity of
character, that I have looked up to the possessor of them as to
something divine. I had wished to have made you acquainted,
in some degree, with my own character, as far as I might have
been supposed to have acquired that most difficultly attained
information, a knowledge of myself. I perceive, however, an
impropriety in saying much upon this subject; but I wish you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
to be assured, that I am incapable of uttering any thing false
or deceitful, and that consequently you may rely upon my word.
I have pursued every object in life with an avidity which has
appeared to many disproportionate to its value; but surely, if
an object be worth attaining, neither diligence should be spared
nor time lost in its attainment. How anxious and earnestly
interested must a person of this disposition, with respect to subjects
of little importance, feel when engaged in what he considers
as the most important concern of his life. I shall suffer
the greatest inquietude until I am assured of your good opinion.
This letter has been written by snatches, in the midst of the
avocations of this day, which now so call upon me, that I can
only add (what I hope may be an unnecessary assurance) that
I shall ever be, with the truest affection, and most faithfully
yours.</p>

<p class="sigleft in0">"<span class="smcap">John Abernethy.</span>"</p>

<p>This beautiful letter is very characteristic. The simplicity
and straightforwardness,&mdash;the respect and tenderness, "Dearest
Lady,"&mdash;the brief, modest, but truthful tone in which he alludes
to his own pretensions,&mdash;the plea for his earnestness deducible
from his known character in ordinary pursuits,&mdash;his frank confession
of anxiety and inquietude until he is assured of her "good
opinion,"&mdash;and his naïveté in saying that his occupations oblige
him to conclude,&mdash;all respectively sketch the natural warmth,
tenderness, sincerity, and earnestness of his real disposition.</p>

<p>The marriage took place accordingly in the parish church of
All Saints, Edmonton, on the 9th of January, 1800, and is thus
entered in the Register:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"John Abernethy, Bachelor, of the Parish of St. Andrew's, Holborn, to
Anne Threlfall, of this Parish, Spinster, were married in this Church by
licence, the 9th day of January, 1800, by me,</p>

<p class="sigright in0">"<span class="smcap">D. Warren</span>, <i>Vicar</i>.</p>

<p>"This marriage was solemnized between us:</p>

<p class="sigright in0">"<span class="smcap">John Abernethy.</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Anne Threlfall.</span></p>

<p>"In the presence of</p>

"<span class="smcap">J. Hodgson.</span><br />

</blockquote>


          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>By marriage Abernethy obtained a partner for life who to
personal attractions added those social and moral excellences
which combine to form a superior woman&mdash;one to whom such a
man as Abernethy could, and always did, to his last moment, look
up with equal respect and affection, as the wife, mother, and the
friend. As a husband, there can be no doubt that, during the
thirty years he lived after his marriage, his conduct was a practical
commentary on, and fulfilment of, the preceding letter; and
he endeavoured at all times to convey to the children the warm
sentiments of respect for, and reliance on, their mother that he
had seen so much reason himself to entertain. On the other
hand, it is impossible to overrate the grateful warmth with which
Mrs. Abernethy returned his affection, or the veneration and
respect with which she honored his memory.</p>

<p>Few persons, if any, have experienced a longer period of uninterrupted
happiness than that which followed the marriage of
Abernethy. Mrs. Abernethy survived him twenty-four years,
having died in July, 1854. She had for many years been afflicted
with paralysis, which at times was attended with considerable
suffering. It was consolatory, however, to feel that her faculties
remained without being materially impaired to the last.</p>

<p>Mr. Abernethy had, in his last illness, repeatedly expressed
his anxiety that every kindness and care should be shown towards
her to whom he felt so much indebted; and he had prophetically
suggested, as probable, what really happened. He said, "Take
every care of your dear mother. She may have many and perhaps
serious illnesses; but she will still be, most likely, a long-lived
woman." This legacy, we have reason to know, was
most fully and kindly administered.</p>

<p>One circumstance, on the occasion of his marriage, is very
characteristic of him: namely, his not allowing it to interrupt,
even for a day, a duty with which he rarely suffered anything to
interfere&mdash;we mean the lecture at the hospital.</p>

<p>Many years after this, I met him coming into the hospital
one day, a little before two (the hour of lecture), and seeing him
rather smartly dressed, with a white waistcoat, I said:</p>

<p>"You are very gay to-day, Sir."</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay," said he; "one of the girls was married this morning."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Sir!" I said. "You should have given yourself a
holiday on such an occasion, and not come down to lecture."</p>

<p>"Nay," returned he. "Egad! I came down to lecture the
day I was married myself!"</p>

<p>On another occasion, I recollect his being sent for to a case
just before lecture. The case was close in the neighbourhood,
and it being a question of time, he hesitated a little; but being
pressed to go, he started off. He had, however, hardly passed
the gates of the hospital before the clock struck two, when, all at
once, he said, "No, I'll be &mdash;&mdash; if I do!" and returned to the
lecture-room.</p>

<p>In all that Abernethy had hitherto published, it was easy to
perceive that, although he was carefully examining the prevailing
opinions and practice of the day, he was emphatically one of those
independent thinkers who had power to overlay the most established
conventionalisms with opinions of his own. Although
hitherto his publications had related to particular diseases or
accidents which were held as within the ordinary province of the
surgeon, he was shadowing forth <i>principles</i>&mdash;views which, if
they were true, must necessarily have a much wider range of application
than to the particular cases which it had been his object
to consider. In 1804, he had sufficiently matured his general
views to think it right to publish them; and this he did in his
book on the "Constitutional Origin of Local Diseases," popularly
known as the "My Book," to which he not unfrequently referred
his patients for a more detailed account of his views, than he
could find time to give in the consulting room. When we reflect
that diseases consist entirely of altered conditions in the structure
or function of some part of the body, a formal announcement that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
they must be greatly influenced by the organs on which <i>the whole
body depends</i> for its nutrition, seems to have so much the aspect
of an obvious truism, that we scarcely know whether most to
wonder at so formal an announcement of it having been necessary,
or the astonishing number and variety of the reservations with
which it has been admitted.</p>

<p>But, strange as this may appear, and although all the facts
have been before the eyes of man for ages&mdash;nay, though their
relations have been <i>more or less felt</i> and acknowledged in cases
usually submitted to the physician,&mdash;we venture to say that
nothing like an attention at all adequate to their importance was
obtained for them in the practice of physic, and scarcely any at
all in surgery, <i>until the time of Abernethy</i>.</p>

<p>At the present time, a great deal has been done to establish,
by the most clear and indisputable demonstration, the practical
usefulness and necessity of the principles to which Abernethy
conducted us, in the cure of diseases, whether medical or surgical.
Still, these principles are much neglected, much misunderstood,
or so <i>imperfectly carried out</i>, as to excite, even in many of the
public, expressions of astonishment. It is, indeed, not too much
to assert, that, even in those cases in which their successful application
has been most incontestibly exemplified, his principles are
<i>fully carried out on comparatively few occasions</i>.</p>

<p>The causes of all this are, we fear, too easily detected; the
removal of them is indeed sufficiently difficult. We may possibly
discuss both points in the sequel.</p>

<p>Instead of the exquisite simplicity and clearness of Abernethy's
views, so far as he had gone, being carefully studied, and
with a view to the <i>extension</i> of them beyond those limits which
his time, his opportunities, and his caution had assigned to them;
instead of examining into, and testing, the practical value of the
deducible, and, in fact, necessary sequences, on views of which he
had demonstrated the truth and value; practice appears to have
taken a retrograde movement.</p>

<p>He who would advance even as far as Abernethy, is in danger
of being regarded as crotchety or peculiar; whilst any who should
strive by a more careful examination of his views to render their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
practical application more definite and analytical, must be prepared
to be looked on simply as an enthusiast.</p>

<p>This has, indeed, been the case more or less in all sciences
from the earliest times. The <i>facts</i> which conduct us to a true
interpretation of the <i>laws</i> in obedience to which they occur, have
been always before us; the very same facts on which, as Professor
Whewell<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor"><sup>29</sup></a> observes, we have raised the stately structure of modern
science. Butler<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor"><sup>30</sup></a> had before made a similar remark. Poets too,
as even the motto to our chapter shows, have held the same sentiment;
what everybody <i>knows</i>, how few <i>consider</i>! Neither Copernicus
nor Galileo altered or invented <i>facts</i>. Those they
<i>observed</i>! what they <i>discovered</i>, were conclusions interpreting the
true relations of them. Bodies fell to the earth, and the crystal
rain-drop had shown the composite nature of light in the beautiful
colours and wonderful illustrations of the rainbow, ages before
Newton discovered the true explanation of the one, and the great
law exemplified in the other.</p>

<p>The object of "the Book" is to set forth the great fact of the
reciprocal influence existing between the nervous system and the
digestive organs, and the power they mutually exert in the causation
and cure of diseases; and this, whether the diseases originate
in disturbance <i>primarily</i> directed to the brain or any other portion
of the nervous system, or to the <i>digestive organs</i>; whether the
result of accident, such as mechanical injury, or other local manifestations
more commonly termed disease. In the book before us
we shall find an ample refutation of many misconstructions and
misapprehensions of Abernethy's views; misconstructions which
have tended to obscure principles, remarkable for their simplicity
and truthfulness; to impede the beneficial application of
them in a manner which has been equally injurious to the
public and the profession, and which, have impressed on mankind
a very inadequate idea of the obligations due to the distinguished
author. His views were said to be theoretical and exaggerated,
whilst they were conclusions logically deduced from facts;
and so far from the pervading power of the influences to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
he proximately attributed the causation and cure of disease having
been exaggerated, the onward study of his principles only serves,
by the discovery of more multiplied and refined applications of
them, to fill in with additional illustrations the accurate outline
which he has so truthfully drawn. He never wrests a fact to a
conclusion to which it does not legitimately lead. In virtue of
that suggestive quality of his mind (so important an aid in philosophical
inquiries), he occasionally, in all his writings, puts forth
suppositions, but these only as <i>questions</i>, the next in the order of
inquiry, and these he asks of nature alone.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunter had been the first in this country to make the
true use of anatomy; I mean in the sense that whilst it was no
doubt the basis of our investigation into the functions or uses of
parts, still it was only <i>one</i> of an extensive series of inquiries.
He had <i>examined</i> the <i>dead</i> with no purpose more earnestly, than
to assist him in his endeavours to <i>observe the living</i>; examined
<i>parts</i>, that he might better understand the whole. He had made
himself familiar with the economy of animals, and generally with
the habits of organized beings, whether animal or vegetable, that
he might know their relations to each other, and that of the <i>whole</i>
to the phenomena, habits, and laws, of the <i>Human</i> economy. As
he neglected no source whence it had been customary to seek for
information, so, notwithstanding his fondness for animals, he
made various experiments on living creatures. But whilst these
experiments afford additional proofs of the poverty, so to speak,
of this plan of investigation, they impress on us the truth of
Sir Charles Bell's assertion, that physiology is essentially a science
of <i>observation</i>. We have only to place Mr. Hunter's <i>observations</i>
and <i>experiments</i> here referred to, in juxtaposition, in order to bring
out in high relief the great meaning and value of the one, and
the unnecessary, or inconclusive, character of the other. He also
examined the various facts presented to him in the <i>living</i> body
with unequalled patience and circumspection.</p>

<p>Amongst others, he had paid particular attention to those
which exemplify that vivid, that watchful connection which exists
between various parts and organs, and by which impressions or
sensations excited in any one part are telegraphed, as it were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
with the swiftness of lightning to any or all of the organs of the
body; facts which may be observed by <i>anybody</i>, by no one better,
and by few so well, <i>as patients</i> themselves. To take a common
example: everybody is familiar with the fact that certain disturbances
of the stomach produce pain or other annoyance in the
head. Every one also knows that in such cases there is very
often no pain, and sometimes no sensation of annoyance in
the stomach; so that were it not from an innumerable succession
of such conditions, in connection with particular influences
on the stomach, we should, from the feeling of the <i>stomach only</i>,
never dream of the cause being in that organ. Now on these
simple facts hang not only the most practical of all John Hunter's
observations, not only the most valuable of Mr. Abernethy's,
but (as far as we can see) those relations through a philosophical
examination of which we shall still most auspiciously seek to
extend our practical knowledge of disease. We see here just
that which Mr. Hunter had asserted&mdash;namely, "that the organ
<i>secondarily</i> affected (in this case, the head) sometimes appeared
to suffer more than the organ to which the disturbance <i>had first</i>
been directed."</p>

<p>He observed also that the connection thus manifested, existed
equally between <i>all other parts</i> and organs; that although it
might be exemplified in different forms, still the association it
implied was indisputable. He adopted the usual terms by which
these phenomena had been designated. Parts were said to <i>sympathize</i>
with each other, and no term could be better, as it simply
expressed the fact of associated disturbance or suffering. It is
true the <i>facts</i> were not at all new; they had always existed; nay,
they had been observed and commented on by many persons ever
since the time of Hippocrates; and if I were to mention the
whole of such facts, there is scarcely one which would not be to
some one or other as familiar as a headache from disturbance of
the stomach. Mr. Hunter, however, had a kind of instinctive
idea of the yet unseen value of the clue thus afforded to the
investigation of disease; and he observed these facts with a
greater attention to all their details than any one, or all, who had
preceded him.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>Hunter's observations on the subject in his lectures were extremely
numerous, and elaborate even to tediousness; Abernethy,
who used to give us a very humorous description of some of the
audiences of John Hunter on these occasions, was accustomed to
say, "That the more humorous and lively part of the audience
would be tittering, the more sober and unexcitable quietly
dosing into a nap; whilst the studious and penetrative few
appeared to be seriously impressed with the value of Mr.
Hunter's observations and inquiries." Mr. Cline, an honoured
name in our profession, and one who, had he lived in later times,
would probably have been as distinguished in advancing science
as he was for his practical excellence, significantly expressed his
impressions of the future importance of the inquiries in which
Hunter was engaged. Addressing Mr. Clift, after one of the
lectures, he said:</p>

<p>"Ah! Mr. Clift, we must all go to school again."</p>

<p>Mr. Abernethy carefully treasured up and pondered on what
he heard. He placed himself as much as he could near Mr.
Hunter; took every pains, which his time and occupations allowed,
thoroughly to understand him; and, with his characteristic tendency
to simplification, said: "Well, what Mr. Hunter tells us,
resolves itself into this: <i>that the whole body sympathizes with
all its parts</i>."</p>

<p>His perceptivity, naturally rapid, was evidently employed in
observing the bearing of this axiom on the facts of disease. The
digestive organs, which, if we extend the meaning to all those
engaged in assimilating our food, compose nearly the whole
viscera of the body, could not escape his attention, nor indeed
fail to be regarded in all experimental investigations of any <i>one
organ</i>. Accordingly, in his paper on the skin and lungs, we
have seen a very important application of the relations between
organs engaged in concurrent functions; we have placed before
us the physiological evidences of their being engaged in a common
function, and the sympathetic association it rendered necessary;
whence he had observed relations of great moment, and pointed
out the practical bearing they <i>must</i> have on Consumption. He
had, however, been paying attention for some time to the digestive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
functions, when his intimate friend, Mr. Boodle, of Ongar in
Essex, gave a fresh stimulus to his exertions. This gentleman
requested him to investigate the functions and conditions of the
liver in various nervous diseases, as also in certain affections of
the lungs, which had appeared to him, Mr. Boodle, to originate
in the former organ. Mr. Abernethy says: "I soon perceived
that the subject was of the highest consequence in the practice
<i>of surgery</i>; for local diseases disturb the functions of the digestive
organs, and, conversely, a deranged state of those organs,
either occurring in consequence of such sympathy, or <i>existing
previously</i>, materially affects the progress of <i>local complaints</i>."</p>

<p>At the very commencement, he hits on a great cause of evil,
and boldly assails one of the most mischievous of all conventionalisms.
"The division of medicine and surgery," he observes,
"is mischievous, as directing the attention of the two orders of
practitioners too exclusively to the diseases usually allotted to
them." There is indeed no exaggerating the evils of that
partial mode of investigation to which such a custom almost
necessarily leads. We fall into error, not because of the difficulty
of the subject, but because we never can, by looking <i>at one set of
diseased processes only</i>, learn the whole of the facts belonging to
the subject. It was just this that prevented Fordyce from arriving
at correct views of fever. Nothing could be more excellent
than the way he <i>began</i> to consider it; but he hardly begins,
before he tells us that he intends to exclude those febrile affections
which fall under the care of surgeons. In doing this, he at
once abandoned a series of facts which are absolutely essential to
the investigation. It must be obvious, on a moment's reflection,
that, if a particular condition of a part have a relation to the
whole body, the study of one without the other, or even if
both be taken up by different persons, nothing but the most imperfect
views can result. A jury, still more a judge, might in
some cases guess from partial evidence the issue of a legal
investigation; but who ever heard of either determining beforehand
to examine a portion only of that evidence? Yet it is
not too much to say, that hardly any legal question can be so
recondite as many inquiries in physiology. The nature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
case is always more or less obscured by a number and variety of
interfering circumstances. Diseases may be regarded, in fact, as
nothing more than natural laws, developed under <i>more or less
complicated circumstances of interference</i>.</p>

<p>Lord Bacon had warned all investigators of Nature of the
danger of attending only to a portion of the facts; it had been
one of the great bars to progress of knowledge in general. I
regret to say that it still continues the bane of <i>almost all medical
inquiries</i>.</p>

<p>Abernethy's inference in relation to this mutilated sort of
investigation is too true, when he observes that "the connection
of all local diseases with the state of the constitution has obtained
little notice;" whereas the truth is, that "no part of an
animal body can be considerably disordered without affecting
the whole system." Now here Mr. Abernethy claims&mdash;what?
Simply this: he claims for <i>function</i>&mdash;that is, <i>the various offices
fulfilled</i> by the several parts and organs of the body&mdash;that which
Cuvier has so beautifully insisted on, and which our own Owen
has so instructively exemplified in regard to <i>structure or formation</i>;
namely, a <i>necessary relation</i> between the whole and all its
parts.</p>

<p>In speaking of affections of the nervous system, Abernethy
observes that the brain may be affected by the part injured, and
that <i>then</i> it may affect the various organs by a "reflected" operation;
but that whatever <i>may be the mode</i> (thus carefully separating
the opinion from the fact), "the fact is indisputable."
He adds that it may affect some organs more than others, and
thus give a character or name to a disease. For example, it
might affect the liver, we will say, when the name which would
be given would probably be expressive of what was a secondary
circumstance&mdash;namely, a disturbance of the liver. This does not
so frequently happen, perhaps, nor so mischievously in relation
to local injuries; but in other cases it is the cause of a great deal
of erroneous and misleading nomenclature.</p>

<p>As we have seen, it often occurs that when the organs of the
body are disordered, the more salient "symptoms," perhaps the
<i>whole</i> of those <i>observed</i>, are referred to a secondarily affected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
organ, and the disease is named from that circumstance. The
too frequent result is, that attention is exclusively directed to
that organ, whilst the <i>cause</i>, being elsewhere, and where there
<i>are no symptoms</i>, wholly escapes observation.</p>

<p>This is a very important branch of inquiry; and as it closely
connects what Abernethy left us with what appears to us to be
one of the next things to be clearly made out, we will endeavour
to illustrate it.</p>

<p>Suppose a person meet with a severe injury, a cut, bruise,
fracture, or any thing that we have seen a hundred times before,
and, instead of being succeeded by the <i>usual</i> processes of repair,
it be followed by some others: the simple expression of the fact
is, that something has interfered with the <i>usual</i> mode and progress
of repair; and as former experience has shown us that there
was nothing in the nature of the injury to account for this, we
are naturally led to look for the explanation of it in the state of
the individual. But if the unusual appearance be one which we
have agreed to call "Erysipelas," and we are accustomed to see
long papers written upon this appearance as a <i>distinct disease</i>,
we acquire a tendency, as every day's experience shows, to regard
it as a kind of abstraction, or as an entity; something composed
of precise and definite relations, contained in that particular
description of case. Yet these relations may not be in any two
successive cases exactly alike. Again, all of them may be subordinate
to some more general character, probably a relation
without which we cannot readily explain the phenomena; but at
which we cannot arrive, because we have not comprehended a
sufficient number of facts in our inquiry to include it.</p>

<p>"Erysipelas" is nothing more than a natural law obscured;
because, as we have just hinted, it is developed under circumstances
of interference (from disordered conditions of the economy)
which distort the natural features of the law, modify its
effects, or which may prevent altogether its full development.
But now, if we study the means afforded by the various links
<i>which other varieties of disease</i> furnish, the ascertainment of the
real relations becomes comparatively <i>easy</i>; and we find that,
whilst there are certain general relations which belong to all cases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
there are certain others which may in a given number in succession
be identical; or in no two exactly the same.</p>

<p>Partial investigations, leading, of course, to erroneous views,
are sure to entail on us a defective nomenclature; and then the
two do very materially contribute to continue the fallacies of each
other. We may have an affection of a lung, perhaps; the cause
may not be in the chest at all, although the lung may be inflamed
or otherwise affected; but we call it Pneumonia, or Pleuritis, or
some other name which <i>simply refers to what is happening to the
part</i>; but all such names have reference only to effects; they are
extremely defective therefore, as comprehending only a portion of
the <i>nature</i>, and having no reference whatever to the <i>seat</i>, of the
<i>cause</i> of the malady. The consequences of all this may not be
<i>necessarily</i> mischievous; but they are so lamentably common, as
to continue to form a very large share of the routine practice.
The cause is elsewhere; but the remedies are directed to the
chest&mdash;that is, they are, in such cases, applied to effects, not
causes. If we must retain names so defective, it would be very
practicable to combine them with something which should indicate
that we had, at least, <i>looked</i> for the cause. This would, at
all events, encourage a habit of looking beyond mere symptoms,
and carry us at least one link higher up the chain of causation.</p>

<p>Abernethy, in demonstrating the connection between local
disease, or injury, and general disturbance, judiciously takes cases
where the relation was most unequivocal; that is, where the local
disturbance consisted of a mechanical injury; such as in a gentleman
who had undergone an operation&mdash;in another who had met
with a bad fracture of his leg. In order to amplify his illustrations
of the connection between the brain and all parts with the
digestive organs, he draws them from all sorts of sources&mdash;from
diseases the most severe and dangerous, as well as from affections
which are regarded as most common or trivial&mdash;from the last
stages of cancer and serious diseases of the loins, to the common
disturbances of teething in children&mdash;sources which, from their
apparent <i>dissimilarity</i>, confer, of course, the strongest force on
testimony in <i>which they combine</i>.</p>

<p>His delineation of the features by which disorders of the digestive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
organs may be generally detected, is remarkably simple,
clear, and truthful.</p>

<p>Every word has the inestimable value also of being alike intelligible
to the public and the profession. His statement is
interspersed with remarks of great value, which, we trust, have
not passed away altogether unimproved: such as, that he had
observed disorder of the digestive organs produce states of health
"similar to those" said to be characteristic of the absorption of
particular poisons&mdash;a most recondite subject; but one, the obscurity
of which has entirely, as we think, resulted from the determination
to regard the diseases to which it refers as <i>abstractions</i>,
and to investigate them under the impenetrable shadow of <i>preconceived</i>
opinions.</p>

<p>Almost all his remarks have received more or less confirmation
from the experience of the whole civilized world. There
are few things in his observations more interesting than the emphatic
way in which they ignore the vulgar impression that he
referred all diseases to the stomach. In the whole round of
scientific literature, it would be difficult to find, in the same space,
so complete or comprehensive a view of <i>all</i> those which we usually
term the digestive organs.</p>

<p>Abernethy was very far from any such narrow views; whilst,
in regard to other organs, to which some of our most distinguished
men had paid particular attention, it is not too much to
say, that, more clear and precise than Curry, and equally careful
with Hunter, not less painstaking than our excellent Prout, he is
more <i>practically</i> penetrating and comprehensive on this subject
than any of them. But as to the charge of exclusive reference
to the stomach, we shall easily see there was no foundation for it.</p>

<p>In speaking of the reciprocal affections of the brain and the
digestive organs, he says: "The stomach is said to be chiefly
concerned in producing these effects; but the cause of the sympathetic
affection is probably more general." Page 48. He
then goes on to exemplify causes acting on the <i>Liver</i>, and so
forth. Page 49.</p>

<p>He distinctly contends that <i>other</i> of the chylopoetic organs
may disturb the brain as well as the stomach. Again, at page<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
52, he repeats a similar opinion, and especially adds, that when
the alimentary canal <i>is</i> affected, we can never be sure that it is
<i>primarily so</i>.</p>

<p>He also says, at page 53, that, in some cases, the disorder of
the digestive organs is dependent on disease of the brain.</p>

<p>I have alluded to these passages, because nothing is more unjust
to Abernethy than to suppose that he attributed everything
to the stomach, or restricted his attention to that or any other
organ. Such a misapprehension also tends indefinitely to impede
the practical application of his principles, and to deprive us of
the advantages which are so constantly derivable from them.</p>

<p>This is so important, that it may be useful to consider a little
the circumstances which may have thus misled the public, and we
fear, not unfrequently, the profession also, in the interpretation of
Abernethy's views.</p>

<p>In conducting the treatment of diseases of the digestive
organs, whatever organ we may desire to influence, either by inducing
tranquillity of the nervous system, or by the selection of
food appropriate to the actual condition of the organ specially
affected, the stomach is necessarily a primary consideration.</p>

<p>The reasons for this are sufficiently obvious, but have not
perhaps been always adequately regarded. Digestion is, on the
whole, a manufacture, so to speak, of a raw material (food) into
a fluid (blood), which is to be absolutely adapted to purposes for
which it is designed. This is effected not by one, but by several
organs, which each produce their respective changes in the
materials submitted to them. If we desire, therefore, to adapt
the work to any organ which is engaged in this process, however
remote it may be from the stomach, which, with the teeth and
other auxiliaries, execute the <i>first</i> process in the manufacture, it
is quite clear that we must begin with the <i>first process</i> to which
we subject the said raw material or food. Say that in a machine
for the manufacture of cloth the spinning apparatus were out of
order, we must begin by giving out a less quantity of wool to the
carding machine, or whatever represented the first process; because,
having once delivered the wrong quantity or quality, we have no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
means of recalling it, and we should only still further derange
the defective machinery.</p>

<p>So in the body; the liver, kidney, and other organs, not excepting
the lungs and skin; their work must all bear relation to
the quantity or quality of raw material, whether their function be
the manufacture of the new product, or the rejection of that which
is useless. So that supposing there were no other reason, no
other than this mechanical relation (which is very far from the
real state of the case), still we must <i>de facto</i> begin with the
stomach, even where we entertain <i>no idea of any</i> special derangement
of that organ. The stomach, however, is very important in
another sense, and has a power of indicating the necessity of
attention to those points which I have endeavoured to illustrate
by the homely similitude of a manufacture.</p>

<p>Wherever impressions <i>first</i> act on the body, nature has placed
a most vigilant guard. This is variously managed in different
cases; the result is the same, and, as it would appear, the final
cause also. In the eye, there is the most beautiful contrivance for
moderating the ingress of light, as also any abrupt increase of
intensity. Fringed curtains are provided which can close with
electrical celerity. Again, the aperture by which light is finally
admitted into the eye is vividly contractile or expansive, as the
occasion may require; then again there are various media of
different densities, through the influence of which even the velocity
of light undergoes practical retardation by repeated refractions;
and lastly, there are powers of sensual adaptation in the
nerve with which the light is ultimately brought in contact, more
wonderful than all.</p>

<p>The ear, being likewise a portal for external impressions, is
guarded with equal care. Not a single vibration of air can ever
reach the nerve of the ear with the crude intensity (if I may use
the expression) with which it is generated. Passing over preliminary
apparatus, by which the vibrations of air are first collected,
the impressions of sound are first received on the parchment of
a little drum, which parchment can be relaxed or tightened with
the quickness of thought, so as to modify the force of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
impression. This impression is then, by means of a little chain
of bones, conveyed across the drum, which is filled with air. It
then reaches a portion of the ear in which are found very curious
cavities and canals, of various forms, and taking different directions,
and which, from the curious and complex arrangement of
the whole, is not inappropriately called the labyrinth. This is the
mysterious seat of those nerves which convey impressions to the
brain. There is, however, here, an arrangement more exquisite
than any we have yet mentioned.</p>

<p>In these cavities and canals, which are themselves so small
as to be not unfit objects for magnifying glasses, there are corresponding
delicate sacs and tubes, and these are filled with a limpid
fluid. On this delicate apparatus, so exquisitely calculated to
modify any undue force of impression, the sensitive extremities
of the auditory nerves are spread out, which convey impressions
to the brain. We see, therefore, how carefully these portals of
the body are guarded; arrangements equally conservative prevail
throughout. We might show a similarly exquisite arrangement
in the laws governing the mind; but that is not our present object.
We have seen hitherto that, beautiful as the arrangement is for
securing us against painful impressions, it has been in a great
degree mechanical.</p>

<p>The stomach, however, is the portal to a vast series of important
organs, and is protected by a phalanx of sentinels, endowed
with powers proportioned to the importance of the organ which
they guard. There is little that falls within any idea which we
can express by the term mechanical; everything is subjected to
an examination essentially sentient; to powers residing in the
nerves; the <i>laws</i> and <i>operations</i> of which, we can with proper
attention trace out, but which exhibit powers demonstrative of an
intensity and refinement of which our limited perceptions scarcely
enable us to form a definite idea.</p>

<p>First, there is the olfactory nerve, between which and the
stomach there is the most vivid sympathy.</p>

<p>Until our tastes become vitiated, the stomach seldom admits
anything of which the nose reports unfavourably. The sense of
smell, even in the somewhat measured power possessed by man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
is capable of detecting forms of matter so subtle as to be beyond
our powers of imagination. Nothing which so plainly deals with
"matter" impresses more strongly the immense range which must
exist between the chemistry of life and that of the laboratory.
We all know the extraordinary powers of musk. I have myself
a small mass of odorous matter (a Goa ball) which, from the
circumstances under which it came into my possession, must have
been emitting the odour for little less than a century. It has
been exposed to air, is covered by a film of gold (I believe), is in
no respect visibly changed, and for the last thirty years not detectably
in weight; yet at this moment it emits as strong an odour
of musk as ever. How exquisitely subtle must be the matter
thus emitted; or how still more wonderful if it merely so modifies
the atoms of air in its neighbourhood as to produce odour. We
have no intellectual powers which enable us to realize a conception
of such infinite tenuity of matter; yet the sense of smell
instantly detects its presence.</p>

<p>Next come the nerves of the tongue; and here again, in natural
conditions, there is a constant harmony between them and the
stomach&mdash;that to which the taste readily gives admission being, in
<i>undisturbed</i> conditions of the economy, some guarantee that it
is innoxious; but what these <i>functions are to the stomach</i>, the
stomach is <i>to the other organs</i>. In the first place, in natural
conditions it usually at once rejects any noxious material which,
from being disguised, or from any other circumstances, may have
eluded the vigilance of the sentinels I have mentioned; but it
has a vivid sympathy with every organ in the body. If anything
deleterious be once admitted, it has to go through various
processes, which may render it a source of indefinite disturbance;
therefore, if any organ in the series of the blood-manufacture be
materially disturbed&mdash;that is, so as to be disabled&mdash;the stomach
usually refuses food; because there is no other way of stopping
the mischief. Illustrations of this occur in many disorders of
the kidney, in many affections of the alimentary canal, as also of
the liver, and other parts.</p>

<p>No doubt the stomach is therefore a most important organ;
but to suppose that it is therefore always the seat of disorder, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
not only a most mischievous error, but a complete blind to its
most beautiful and instructive relations; and as opposite to Mr.
Abernethy's views as the most narrow can be to the most comprehensive.
Proceeding with his illustrations, Mr. Abernethy
cites a number of most instructive cases, such as palsy and other
affections of most serious character, which too often result either
from organic disease of some organ, or from mechanical pressure
on the brain or spinal marrow, but which in the cases cited depend
on disorder of the digestive organs.</p>

<p>It is impossible to exaggerate the interest or importance of
these cases; not only from the fact that they almost certainly
would have led to organic disease, but also for the value of that
practical discrimination which they exemplify. Again, the very
treatment which would have been proper, which had sometimes
been begun, and which was not inappropriate to cases of <i>organic</i>
disease, with which the symptoms were in part identical, would
have inevitably, in the cases in question, only served to exasperate
the very conditions they were designed to relieve, and to hasten
those processes against which they were intended to guard.</p>

<p>No one can understand the force of these cases, without recollecting
the intense difficulty of ascertaining that point at which
disorder ceases to be merely functional, and at which organic
disease begins. This is of all things the most difficult to
determine in the whole circle of physiological or pathological
inquiry.</p>

<p>The <i>symptoms alone</i> are absolutely useless in any case of real
difficulty. Of that Abernethy was well aware, and he did much to
guard us against the error into which a reliance on them was
calculated to lead. He knew that organs which were diseased
would sometimes afford indications not distinguishable from those
of health; and that, conversely, organs essentially sound would
sometimes only afford those signs which were indicative of disorder.
We have, we trust, made some little progress in this
very difficult branch of inquiry; and although it is true that
organic disease not unfrequently escapes detection during life,
yet, so far as we have observed, it is only in those cases in which
there is, notwithstanding the daily lessons of experience, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
<i>improper reliance</i> on what are called the symptoms. We assert,
without the least hesitation, that organic diseases should seldom
elude detection where the investigation is sufficiently comprehensive;
but it must include <i>all the facts</i> of the case, the early
history, and such circumstances which, however remote, have been
over and over again proved to be capable of exerting an influence
on the body; an investigation which, however vainly pleaded for
in medical science, however regarded as too exacting, involves
nothing more in principle than is required as a matter of course
<i>in all other</i> scientific investigations.</p>

<p>When these conditions are observed, it is very rarely that we
cannot detect organic affections in organs in which there may be
no <i>present</i> symptoms. In relation to the <i>extent</i> to which they
may be affected, it is true we have yet much to learn; still, if
cases be judged of not by the history <i>merely</i>, nor by the symptoms
<i>merely</i>, but by both in conjunction, and if to these be added
a careful observation of the <i>amount</i> of work that the organs are
separately or collectively doing, as <i>compared with their natural
proportions</i>; together with a careful estimate of that which the
actions of any visible disease may be eliminating from the body;
then, indeed, we have good ground for hope that means will be
opened to us of distinguishing more accurately various states of
the system; and additional principles and powers disclosed of
readjusting the disturbed balance of the various functions, which
is the essential element of disease.</p>

<p>Abernethy, in impressing any anatomical fact, would sometimes
say that we carried about with us in our own bodies
excellent means of refreshing our impressions on many points of
anatomy; but we may say this in a much more extensive sense
with regard to the interpretation of that for which anatomy is
alone useful&mdash;namely, the <i>uses</i> or <i>functions</i> of the body. It
would be very possible for any observant person, who was moderately
versed in the ordinary principles of correct reasoning, to
detect many defects in medical investigations and practice; in
the correction of which many of Abernethy's practical contributions
consisted; but the mind, restlessly impatient to arrive at
conclusions, often overlooks the most important facts, and deduces
inferences <i>directly</i> from the evidence of the eye or other senses,
without submitting it to such test as the intellectual faculty can
alone supply. Nothing can exceed the mischief of this in serious
matters, nor the absurdity of it, when we <i>think awhile</i>.</p>

<p>We should hardly refrain from laughter if we saw a man try
to see with the point of his nose, or endeavour to examine the
odour of a rose by his ear, or to listen with his eye; yet this is
not a whit more absurd than to try to deduce conclusions from
the impressions furnished by the eye, which can alone be afforded
by the rational faculty. Nothing is more common than this sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
of fallacy, nothing more easy than its correction; but then people
must bestow at least a little of that time on their highest faculties
which they so lavishly expend on inferior powers. How
much time we consume, for example, in the study of various
languages&mdash;those instruments for the communication of ideas&mdash;as
compared with that bestowed on the collecting and marshalling
of ideas themselves; which is little better than grasping at the
shadow, and losing the substance; or, to use a humorous illustration,
like a friend of our own, who, having a new dog, sent
his servant forthwith to purchase sundry articles for him, in the
shape of kennel, chains, engraved collars and food; all of which,
at some expense, he safely accomplished to his master's satisfaction,
expressing his sorrow at the same time for having accidentally
lost the dog!</p>

<p>It is curious, however, to observe how the real business of
the human mind is shadowed forth in the very abuses of its
powers; nothing so bad but it is charged with a certain quantity
of good; no error so great but carries with it the element of its own
correction. The mind in its greatest aberrations is followed by
the shadow of its real duty, which as it were waits on the time
when clearer views shall burst on it. Nothing shows the real
tendencies of mind more than its restless desire to arrive at <i>some</i>
conclusion, <i>some</i> tangible evidence of its highest functions. It is
the impulse of this instinct&mdash;the ungoverned abuse of a high
faculty, impatient for illegitimate fruition&mdash;which lies at the bottom
of much false reasoning, and which blinds men, even of great
power, to obstacles which are luminously evident to the most ordinary
capacity. Important as the next series of illustrations
cited by Abernethy are, the conclusions he deduced from them
were the necessary sequences of clear and correct reasoning on
familiar and established facts.</p>

<p>The illustrations in question were those afforded by various
cases of injuries of the head, in which certain consequences, however
exceptional they may be, are too commonly referred to the
abstract nature of the injury. We <i>see</i> that a man has a blow,
we <i>see</i> that he does not recover in the usual way in which we
have known many others to recover; but we do not, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
<i>consider</i> that if a similar&mdash;nay, perhaps an identical force produces
very different effects in different cases, the cause will probably
not be in the nature or direction of the force so much as the condition
of the body. Now the value of these cases of Abernethy's
consists, first, in impressing the influence of this condition as
modifying&mdash;in other words, <i>sustaining</i>&mdash;the disturbance consequent
on injuries (in their origin) purely mechanical; and secondly,
in showing that, in the cases in question, <i>that condition</i>
depended on a disordered state of the digestive organs. We
hardly know any cases more valuable than those in question.
When a patient receives a blow, and, the <i>immediate</i> consequences
having subsided, there still remains an impairment of sense or
motion, the most usual thing, and no doubt very often the true
view, is to refer it all to lesion of nervous structure. It is therefore
of the highest consequence to know the facts of these cases.
They not only prevent the hasty institution of treatment which
would be injurious; not only secure the patient from being abandoned
in despair; but supply at the same time the clues to a
rational treatment, and the hope of a favourable issue.</p>

<p>There can now be few observant surgeons who have not met
with cases in illustration of these circumstances; and yet I know
not to whom the perusal of Mr. Abernethy's cases might not be
useful. It is not without regret that I forego transcribing at
least one of them; forgetful how impossible it is to do Abernethy
full justice in a work intended for all readers. In his "Book,"
the cases in question begin at page 97, and occupy but a few
pages.</p>

<p>The next class of cases, from which Abernethy illustrates the
prevailing influence of the digestive organs, receives additional
importance from the <i>imperfect</i> manner in which the phenomena
have been interpreted in a vast variety of diseases; like small-pox
and others, ascribed to the action of particular poisons. We
may possibly have an opportunity of saying something more on
this subject; but we may remark that when any disease has been
presented to the physician or surgeon, supposed to be the result
of specific poisons, it is just the last case in which any special
attention is paid to the digestive organs. Now Abernethy observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
that disorders of the digestive organs would sometimes
<i>produce</i> diseases resembling maladies said to result from specific
poisons. This is about the first indication or hint of that which,
duly carried out by an advancing science, will, we trust, ere long,
demonstrate what to <i>us</i> has long appeared only part of a general
law. Of this we may by and by say a little more, when we endeavour
to show the small quantity of truth which there is mixed
with some of the prevailing errors; and how their occasional
success results from blundering, as it were, on small portions of
the principles enunciated by Abernethy.</p>

<p>In the meantime, we may refer to the illustration afforded by
small-pox of the remarkable influence of the digestive organs in
diseases called specific. We adduce this, because it is one which
is popularly familiar, and a disease that, had it been studied under
any but one particular phase, would have proved, of all others,
the most instructive. There is no malady, under certain circumstances,
more extensively fatal.</p>

<p>In the Spanish conquest in America&mdash;a history scarcely less
interesting in a medical than in a moral point of view&mdash;it seems
that not all the cruelties of the Spaniards were more destructive
than the small-pox. In less than a century after the arrival of
Columbus, it was computed that it had destroyed more than half
the population; and in one year (1590), it so spread along the
coast of Peru, that it swept away nearly the whole of the Indians,
the Mulattoes, and the Mestichos, in the cities of Potosi and
De la Hay<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor"><sup>31</sup></a>.</p>

<p>As is well known, before the discovery of vaccination, persons
were <i>inoculated</i> with the small-pox, because it was found that the
disease could <i>be thus rendered</i> comparatively harmless; whilst, if
it was taken naturally, as it was termed, it was always serious,
and too frequently extremely fatal. The preparation for inoculation
consisted of <i>measures addressed to the digestive organs</i>.
Now the effect may be judged of by this fact: Inoculation was at
first violently opposed; and, in reply to the alleged safety of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
an opponent wrote to prove that <i>one</i> in <i>one</i> hundred and eighty-two
had died of it. I wish we could say so of many other
diseases.</p>

<p>That such persons had, nevertheless, the genuine malady, was
proved by the fact they were capable of infecting others (unprepared)
with the disease in its most malignant form. But our
notions of the mode in which the laws of the animal economy
deal with injurious influences of this kind, are mischievously conventional.
What quantities, for example, of mercury, in its different
forms, have been administered in almost all diseases; and
yet unquestionably there is a great deal of false reasoning in
regard to this poison. Effects are attributed to it <i>as mercury</i>,
which only belong to it in <i>its general character of an injurious
agent</i>. All the (so-called) specific effects of it, most of which are
become popularly familiar, may occur without any mercury at all.
We have seen them induced by aloes, by scammony; and in a
case where no medicine had been given, and where the only detectable
poison was one which was to be sure bad enough, an
enormously loaded liver.</p>

<p>We are obliged to say but little here in connection with this
subject. Abernethy's cases were very important in relation to the
influence of the digestive organs, although he did not see the
generalization to which, as it appears to us, they help to conduct
the pathologist. The subject is too extensive for discussion here.
We will attempt something of a popular view of it, when we endeavour
to explain the fallacy to which we have already referred.</p>

<p>Abernethy next adduces various illustrations from cases of
other diseases; as indurations, tumours, carbuncles, scrofulous
affections, and others; in proof of the dependence of a "numerous
and dissimilar progeny" of so-called local diseases, on that
"fruitful parent," disorder of the digestive organs. Of one of
the most interesting and remarkable cases of tumour, Mr. Abernethy
did not live to see the termination. It was of a lady who
consulted him previous to the proposed infliction of an operation.
She had been recommended by my father, in the country, to consult
Abernethy before submitting to it; because he disapproved
of it, as did Abernethy&mdash;not because they doubted of the nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
of the disease, but because it was not confined to the part on
which it was proposed to operate.</p>

<p>The lady used to call on Abernethy when she came to town;
and after his death she came to me&mdash;as she said, just to report
her condition. She had at times various disturbances of her
digestive organs; but always from some imprudence; for, although
habitually very simple in her habits, she would be sometimes
careless or forgetful.</p>

<p>She died at a very advanced age&mdash;between seventy and eighty&mdash;but
there had been no return of the disease for which she had
originally consulted Abernethy, nor had she undergone any
operation. It is a significant circumstance, too, that she had a
sister who died of cancer.</p>

<p>The whole of the cases are, however, scarcely less valuable.
In the fifth section, he treats of disorders of parts having continuity
of surface with the alimentary canal, certain affections of
the nose, of the eye, and of the gullet or œsophagus. His observations
on the latter are especially valuable. They strike at
that meddling practice which is too common in the treatment of
diseases of these parts. Many of us have recommended a practice
which, without neglecting either, relies <i>less</i> on manipulatory
proceedings, and more on measures directed to the general health,
in such cases; as producing effects which are not to be obtained
by other means; but, if we are to judge from the medical periodicals,
without much success; so inveterate is the habit of
imagining that, whatever the causes of disease may be, if the
<i>results</i> be but <i>mechanical</i>, mechanical means can alone be applicable.
Public attention, and the perusal of such cases as those
of Abernethy, can alone correct these errors.</p>

<p>Lastly, he describes the results of his dissections as bearing
on the whole subject. Here he shows, that whilst disordered
function may take place coincidentally with, or as a consequence
of, change of structure, yet that such change, so <i>as to afford visible
or detectable departures</i> from natural appearances, is by no means
necessary, in <i>organs which, during life</i>, had afforded the most
incontrovertible evidence of impaired function. He also shows
that disease has <i>terminated</i> in <i>disorder</i> which had its original seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
in the digestive organs. And again&mdash;that, in cases where the
cause of death had been in the abrogated <i>function</i> of the brain, he
found no actual <i>disease</i> in that organ, but in the <i>abdominal viscera</i>.
He very justly observes that the conclusions he has drawn
can be <i>neither</i> ascertained nor disproved by anatomical evidence
<i>alone</i>. He mentions especially, and illustrates by a remarkably
successful case, how <i>diseases of the lungs</i> may be engendered by
disorders of the digestive organs, and <i>entirely</i> subdued by correction
of that disorder.</p>

<p>He speaks also suggestively of the possibility of that which is
certainly now an established fact. He says: "In cases of diseased
lungs, where no disease of the digestive organs is discovered,
yet considerable <i>disorder</i> does exist, and may continue
for many years without any <i>organic</i> disease being <i>apparent</i>; it
is possible that such disorder may excite disease of the lungs,
and thus produce a <i>severer</i> disease of the latter organs than
what existed in the former. Accurate attention to the <i>digestive
organs may determine this important subject, and lead to the
prevention and cure of the sympathetic diseases which I have
mentioned</i>." "This attention must not be merely of that general
kind which adverts only to the quality of the ingesta, &amp;c.,
but one which more strictly observes whether the viscera" (that
is, reader, not merely the stomach, not merely the digestive
organs, but the whole viscera of the body) "and whether these
secretions are healthy or otherwise." After speaking of the
heart also, as affected by the digestive organs; and of the infinity
of diseases which arise from the reciprocal disturbance excited
between them and the brain;&mdash;he says: "But even these are not
the worst consequences. The disorder of the sensorium, excited
and aggravated (by the means which he has described), affects
the mind. The operations of the intellect become enfeebled,
perplexed, and perverted; the temper and disposition, irritable,
unbenevolent, and desponding. The moral character and conduct
appears even to be liable to be affected by these circumstances.
The individual in this case is not the only sufferer,
but the evil extends to his connections and to society. The
subject, therefore, appears to me to be of such importance, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
no apology need be offered for this imperfect attempt to place it
under general contemplation." Here is that suggestion which,
when carried out, leads to the detection of cases of insanity which
depend on disturbances of the digestive organs.</p>

<p>Lastly, as if, notwithstanding his own previous attention to
the important question of the influence of the digestive organs in
disease, he felt that the inquiry had grown upon him in consequence
of Mr. Boodle's endeavour to concentrate his attention to
the subject, he concludes by expressing his past obligations to
Mr. Boodle; for he says, with admirable modesty and candour,
"for Mr. Boodle first instructed me how to detect disorders of
the digestive organs, <i>when their local symptoms were so trivial
as to be unnoticed</i> by the patient." He urges Mr. Boodle to
publish also his own observations on the subject, because any
remarks from one who observes the progress of disease "with
such sagacity and accuracy, cannot but be interesting." We
are quite aware how feeble our attempt has been to do justice to
this admirable book. But nothing can do that but a careful
study of the various principles which it either suggests, dimly
shadows forth, or deeply and beautifully unfolds.</p>

<p>Through not a very short life, we have had ample opportunity
of testing these principles by the bedside, and of endeavouring
to connect some of them with the laws in obedience to which
they occur; and we are free to declare our impression that when
the book is studied with the requisite previous knowledge, and
freedom from preconceived opinion; and when tested and carried
out in <i>principle</i>, as distinguished from any adhesion to mere
matters of <i>detail</i>; we think it infinitely more valuable than all
other professional works whatever. In examining the truths it
unfolds, or in our humble endeavours elsewhere at a more analytical
or extended application of them, like Abernethy, we have
rested our reasoning wholly on facts and observations which are
acknowledged and indisputable.</p>

<p>Whilst other views have only led to a practice in the highest
degree empirical, or, what is worse, conjectural, those of Abernethy's
lead often directly, but always <i>when duly studied</i>, to a
practice at once clear, definite, and in the sense in which we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
qualify the word "positive,"&mdash;that is, one which gives us the
power (when we really have the management of the case) of
predicting the success or failure; which is at least a ripple indicative
of a coming science.</p>

<p>In order, however, to carry out this clearly, we shall at once
add what we think necessary to the profession and the public on
the subject. The <i>general relation</i> of Abernethy's labours to a
real and definite science will be better developed in our concluding
Summary; when we may have an opportunity of stating
what further appears to have been done, and what is yet required.
It will have been perhaps already observed that Abernethy's
views involve a few very simple propositions: first, that disturbance
of a <i>part</i> is competent to disturb the whole system; and
conversely, that disturbance of the <i>whole system</i> is competent to
disturb any <i>part</i>. That the disturbance may <i>commence</i> in the
brain or nervous system, may then disturb the various organs,
and that these may again by reflected action disturb the brain,
and so reciprocally; and that in all these cases tranquillity of the
digestive organs is of the very first consequence; not merely from
its abstract importance, but from the influence it exerts on the
state of the nervous system.</p>

<p>With respect to any influences immediately directed to the
nervous system, these we apprehend to be few and simple; some
kinds of medicine, are, no doubt, in particular cases useful, none
are susceptible of <i>general</i> application. None of them are <i>certain</i>;
and sedatives of all kinds, which appear to have the most direct
influence on the nervous system, either require to be employed
with the utmost caution, or are in the highest degree objectionable.
But there are other <i>direct</i> influences, certainly; and very
important they are. Quiet, avoidance of disturbing external impressions,
whether of light, sound, temperature, &amp;c. whether in
fact of mind or body; but, in the majority of mankind, how few
of them we can, in a strictly philosophical sense, command.
We are therefore driven to other sources of disturbance; and in
the digestive organs we find those on which we can exert great
influence, and in which tranquillity, however procured or under
whatever circumstances, is <i>certain</i>, <i>pro tanto</i>, to relieve the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
system. This Abernethy attempted, and with a success which
was remarkable in no cases more than those which had resisted
all more ordinary modes of proceeding; by general measures, by
simplicity of diet, by occasional solicitation of this or that organ,
by air and exercise, and measures which were directed to the
general health. No doubt in some cases he failed, and so we
shall in many; but let us look boldly at the cause, and see whether
we do not fail a great deal more from our own ignorance
than from any natural impossibility.</p>

<p>To examine the question, we must for the moment forget our
admiration of Abernethy; be no longer dazzled by his genius,
but look only to our duty; endeavour to discover his defects, or
rather those of the state of the question when he left us, and see
what further investigation has afforded in aid of supplying them.</p>

<p>In the first place, we must examine a little further that proposition
which we have seen both in Hunter and Abernethy under
different forms. Hunter says the disturbance of the organ sympathizing
is sometimes more prominent than that of the organ
with which it sympathizes. Abernethy says that the organ primarily
affected is sometimes very little apparently disturbed, or
not even perceptibly so.</p>

<p>Now, from both these statements, we find that there may be
no signs in the primarily affected organ; which, practically rendered,
is nothing more or less than saying that in many cases we
must not seek for the primarily affected organ where <i>the symptoms
are</i>; and this is a great fact: because, although it does not necessarily
teach us what we must do, it exposes the broken reed on
which so many rely. Now the further point, which, as we would
contend, time and labour have supplied, is first this&mdash;that what
Hunter had mentioned as one feature in the history of the sympathies
of different organs, and Abernethy as an occasional or not
unfrequent occurrence, is, in disorders of any standing, and with
the exception of mechanical injury, <i>in fact the rule</i>&mdash;the <i>symptoms</i>
of disorder being almost <i>never</i> in the primary organ; nay, even
organic change (disease) is for the <i>most part</i> first seen in a <i>secondarily</i>
affected organ. In regard to primarily affected parts, the
skin only excepted, they will be found, in the vast majority of
cases, to be one or other of the digestive organs.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>I will endeavour to render the cause of this intelligible. A
minute examination of what happens in a living person, especially
if it be extended to some thousands of cases, will soon disclose to
the most unlettered person a few instructive facts, showing that
Nature has a regular plan of dealing with <i>all</i> injurious influences,
which, however <i>various</i> many of the <i>details</i> may be, is in general
character exquisitely simple, surprisingly beautiful, and intelligibly
conservative; and that the various modes on which she
exercises this plan, from the cradle to the grave, are, in <i>frequency,
directly in the order of their conservative tendency</i>. Let us explain.
There is no dearth of illustration; the <i>facts</i> are bewilderingly
abundant; the difficulty is which to choose, and how to
give them an intelligible <i>general expression</i>. Let us take a single
case. We know that if a mote gets into the eye, there is irritation,
immediately there is flow of blood to the part, a gland pours
forth an abundant supply of tears, and the substance is probably
washed out. Very well; we say that is intelligible. But suppose
you have the vapour of turpentine, or any other irritant, the
same thing happens; but still you cannot give quite the same
<i>mechanical</i> explanation.</p>

<p>Again&mdash;substances which affect the mouth, nose, and stomach,
will irritate the eye without any contact, and cause a flow of
tears.</p>

<p>Lastly, you know that affections of the mind will do this, and
where even we have no <i>mechanical</i> irritant at all.</p>

<p>In <i>all</i> these cases there has been activity of the vessels of the
eye, and in all it has been relieved by secretion. Now this is the
universal mode throughout the body; all irritation of the organs
is attended by secretion; and where this is done, there is no disorder;
or rather, the disorder is relieved: but if organs are irritated
<i>continuously</i>, another thing happens, and that is, that an
organ becomes unable to secrete constantly more than is natural,
and then <i>some other</i> organ, less irritated in the commencement,
takes on an additional duty&mdash;that is, the duty of the animal economy
is <i>still done</i>, but <i>not equally</i> distributed.</p>

<p>This is the state in which most people are in crowded cities,
and who live in the ordinary luxury or the ordinary habits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
civilized society, according to the section to which they may
belong. It is easy, in such cases, to detect those differences
which distinguish this state from what is called condition or perfect
health, as we have elsewhere shown<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor"><sup>32</sup></a>.</p>

<p>But of course there is <i>a limit to this power</i> in organs of taking
on additional or compensating actions; and when this limit is
exceeded, then those actions are instituted which we call Disease.
The site is <i>seldom found</i> to be that of the original disturbance;
and usually for a very plain reason&mdash;because there it would be
more dangerous, or fatal. It would be scarcely less serious in
many cases, even though placed on organs <i>secondarily</i> affected;
and therefore it is more usually determined <i>to the surface</i> of the
body; where, taking them simply in the order of their greatest
number, or frequency, we find the first class of diseased appearances,
and which strikingly impress the real nature of <i>the law</i>.
They are the most numerous, most obviously dependent on general
disturbance, and most conservative, as being least fatal.
Diseases of the skin are those to which we allude, and which, in
the characters I have mentioned, exceed all other diseases.</p>

<p>Again&mdash;the next surface is that involution of the skin which
covers the eye, and which lines the mouth, throat, and the whole
of the interior surface of the respiratory tubes and the digestive
organs. Here again we find the <i>next</i> seat of greatest frequency,
and the conservative tendency, to coincide. We need only refer
to the comparative frequency of what are called colds, ordinary
sore throat, and so forth; as contrasted with those more serious
diseases which occur in the corresponding surfaces of the respiratory
organs and alimentary canal. In tracing diseases onwards
in the order of their number, we never lose sight of this conservative
tendency. When <i>organs</i> become involved in disease, we
find that, for once that the <i>substance</i> of the organ is so <i>affected</i>,
the <i>membrane covering</i> it is affected a hundred, perhaps a thousand
times. This is equally observable with respect to the brain,
heart, lungs, digestive organs, and some other parts; and it is of
great importance practically to know how readily affections are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
transferred from the <i>lining</i> of the alimentary canal and other
parts to the membrane <i>covering</i> it, rather than to the intermediate
texture of the organ; again impressing, though now in a dangerous
type truly, the conservative <i>tendency</i> of the law.</p>

<p>Finally, then, we arrive at diseases of Organs; and here we
see this conservative tendency still typed in the site first chosen,
which is almost always (where we can distinguish the two structures)
not so much in the <i>actual tissue</i> of the organ as in that
which connects it together&mdash;what we term the <i>cellular tissue</i>.</p>

<p>This is remarkable in the lungs; where tubercular deposits
are first seated; not in the essential structures of the organs, but
in those by which they are joined together. All those various
depositions also which are called tumours, generally begin in, and
are frequently confined to, the <i>cellular tissue</i>; and even though
there is, in certain malignant forms of tumour, a disposition to
locate themselves in organs, there is a very curious tendency towards
such, as may have <i>already fulfilled</i> their purposes in the
animal economy.</p>

<p>We might multiply these illustrations to a tedious extent.
We might show, for example, in the eye, how curiously the
greatest number of diseases in that organ are placed in structures
least dangerous to the organ; and even when the organ is spoiled,
so to speak, how much more frequently this is in relation to its
function as <i>an optical instrument</i>, than to the structure which
forms the link with the brain, as <i>an organ of sensation</i>. I must,
however, refer those who wish to see more of the subject, to the
work<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor"><sup>33</sup></a> in which it is more fully discussed, under the term, "The
Law of Inflammation," which is a bad phrase, as imperfectly expressing
the law; but as the greatest evils it exposes occur in
cases of Inflammation, and as it shows the essential nature of that
process to be entirely distinct from the characters which had been
usually ascribed to it, every one of which may be absent so that
expression was somewhat hastily given to the generalization which
seemed best to express a great practical fact.</p>

<p>To return to the bearing of all this on Abernethy's views, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
in relation to organs primarily or secondarily affected. In obedience
to the conservative law to which I have above alluded,
defective function in one organ is usually accompanied by increased
action in some other; and thus it happens that the symptoms
are <i>almost always</i> in one organ, whilst the cause, or originally
injurious influence, has acted on another. The general reader
will, of course, understand that we are not speaking of direct mechanical
injury to an organ. <i>Now</i> all the most recondite diseases
of the kidney are already acknowledged by many to be seated in
a secondarily affected organ. Still the practice is, in too many
instances, a <i>strange mixture</i> of that which is in accordance with
the true view, more or less marred by much <i>that is in opposition
to it</i>; because it often includes that which is certain more or less
to <i>disturb</i> the organ which it should be the object to tranquillize
or relieve.</p>

<p>In the same manner, the lungs and heart are continually disordered,
and ultimately diseased, from causes which primarily act
on the liver; and I have seen such a case treated with cod-liver
oil and bitter ales, with a result which could not but be disastrous.
The liver sends an enormous quantity of blood to the
heart and lungs, from which it ought previously to have extracted
a certain quantity of carbon (bile). If this be not done, the heart
and lungs are oppressed both by the quantity and the quality of
the blood sent to them. If nothing happen in either of the various
sites I have mentioned, the blood must be got rid of; and
it is so. In many cases, a vessel gives way; or blood is poured
out from a vessel; or blood is employed in building up the structures
of disease; but then the <i>symptoms</i> are frequently altogether
in the chest, and not a sign of anything wrong in the liver.</p>

<p>I cannot go on with the multitudinous illustrations of these
principles. The law is to determine injurious influences to the
surface. Deposition in the cellular tissue of the lung is bad
enough; but it is better&mdash;that is, less certainly fatal&mdash;there, than
in the respiratory tubes: and that is the explanation.</p>

<p>But now comes the practical point. How is the primary
organ to be got at? because that is the way to carry out the
removal of the impediments to the sanative processes of nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
which, in many cases, no <i>mere general</i> treatment can accomplish.
This is to be found by an examination into the <i>whole</i> (that is, the
former <i>as well as</i> the more recent) history of the case, and adding
the further test of a real and careful observation of all the secretions.</p>

<p>By going back to the former life of the patient, we shall seldom
fail to discover the various influences to which he has been
subjected, and the organs to which they have been originally
addressed. Having made up our minds, from our previous knowledge
of injurious influences, on what organ they will most probably
have acted, we now test this, not merely by inquiry after
symptoms&mdash;and it may be not by symptoms at all&mdash;but by careful
observation of the <i>actual work</i> of the suspected organ. In this
way we almost certainly discover the real offender; in other words,
the organ primarily affected. This is of immense importance;
for we confidently affirm that <i>one single beneficial impression made
on it</i> will do more in a short time&mdash;nay, in some rare instances,
<i>in a single day</i>&mdash;than years of routine treatment, that has been,
nevertheless, of good <i>general</i> tendency.</p>

<p>In treating it&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> the primary organ&mdash;however, great discrimination
is necessary. If it be already organically affected,
that treatment which would be, under <i>other circumstances</i>, necessary,
becomes either objectionable, or requiring the utmost caution.
For although an organ <i>diseased in structure</i> will, under some
circumstances, as Abernethy long ago observed, yield its characteristic
secretion, yet, unless we know the <i>extent</i> of the disease,
which is just the thing we can almost never be certain about,
excitement of it is <i>never without danger</i>. We should therefore
excite the primary organ with more or less energy, with more or
less caution, or <i>not at all</i>, according to circumstances. If we
determine on not exciting it, we should then act on organs <i>with</i>
which it has ordinarily closest <i>community</i> of function, or on whose
integrity we can most depend. For choice, we prefer organs
which, in a natural state, have nearest identity of function, as
having the readiest sympathy, it may be, with each other. Yet
so universal is the sympathy between all the organs, that there is
no one that will not, under certain circumstances, or which may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
not be induced, perhaps, by judicious management, to take on
<i>compensating</i> actions.</p>

<p>We must not here pursue this subject further. We have
endeavoured to sketch certain extensions of the views of Mr. Abernethy,
and can only refer the profession and the public, for the
facts and arguments which demonstrate and illustrate them, to
those works in which they have been enunciated<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor"><sup>34</sup></a>. They have
now been subjected to severer trials, and abundant criticisms.
So far as we know, they have not been shaken; but if there be
any merit in them, if they shall have made any nearer approach
to a definite science, or sketched the proofs that Induction alone
can place us in a position to talk of science at all, <i>they are still
sequences which have been arrived at by a steady analysis of
Abernethy's views</i>. It was he who taught us, in our pupil days,
first to think on such subjects; to him we owe the first glimpse
we ever had of the imperfect state of medical and surgical science;
and if we do not wholly owe to him the means by which we conceive
it can alone be rendered more perfect and satisfactory, he
has at least in part exemplified the application of them. If we
have made some advances on what he left us, and added to his
beautiful and simple general views, something more definite on
some points, something more <i>analytical</i> on others,&mdash;still, inasmuch
as they are clear deductions from the views he has left us,
and from such views alone, such advances remind us that the
study of his principles serves but to demonstrate their increasing
usefulness, and to augment the sum of our obligations.</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">SECTION.</p>

<p>Mr. Abernethy's book "On the Constitutional Origin of
Local Diseases" had an extensive circulation, and excited a great
deal of attention from the public as well as the profession.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>As a work which may be read as it were in two days, so as a
person read it with one or other subject, it produced a great
variety of impressions. It may be read simply as a narrative of
a number of facts, with the inferences immediately deducible from
them. All this is plain and intelligible at once to anybody, and
of great practical value; but the work contains numerous observations
of a suggestive kind, which require careful thought, and
some previous knowledge, to enable a person to estimate their
value, or to trace their onward relations. The impression made
by the work on different minds varied, of course, with the reader,
his information, and, in some sort, with the spirit in which it was
studied. Some, who had, in their solitary rides, and in the equally
solitary responsibilities of country practice, been obliged to think
for themselves, recognized, in the orderly statement of clearly
enunciated views, facts and principles which they had already seen
exemplified in their own experience, and hailed with admiration
and pleasure a book which realized their own ideas, and supplied
a rational explanation of their truth and value.</p>

<p>Some, who had never thought much on the subject, and were
very ill-disposed to begin, regarded his ideas as exaggerated, and
hastily dismissed the subjects, with the conclusion that he was a
clever man, but too full of theory, and too much disposed to look
to the stomach or the digestive organs. Others, making very
little distinction between what they heard of the man, the book,
or his practice, and probably not having seen either, but deriving
only a kind of dreamy notion of a clever man with many peculiarities,
would say that he was mad, or an enthusiast. Still, a
great many of the thinking portion of the public and the profession
held a different tone. The book was recognized as an intelligible
enunciation of definite views&mdash;rather a new thing in
medical science. The application of them became more and more
general; his pupils were everywhere disseminating them, more or
less, in the navy, in the army, in the provinces, and in America.</p>

<p>Still, it must not be imagined that his principles became diffused
with that rapidity which might have been inferred from his
numerous and attentive class. Constituted as medical education
is, but more especially as it was at that time&mdash;for it is <i>slowly</i> improving&mdash;pupils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
were almost entirely absorbed in the conventional
requisitions for examination. There, they were not questioned as
to the laws of the animal economy, nor any <i>laws</i> at all, nor even
on any real axioms in approximation to them; but simply as to
plain anatomy, the relative situation of parts, and such of the
ordinary surgery of the day as had received the approbation of the
Examiners, who were, for the time, the authorities in the profession.
Therefore, out of a large number, there were comparatively
few whose attentions were not too much absorbed by the
prescribed curriculum of hospital routine to study principles:
a curriculum constructed as if the object were to see how much
could be learnt in a short time, without detriment to the very
moderate requisitions of the examination at the College of Surgeons.
But if comparatively few had time to study Abernethy's lectures
at the time, a great many had treasured up his remarks. As the
impressions we receive in our childhood, before we are capable of
thinking of their value, are vividly rekindled by the experience of
real life, so many of the more suggestive lessons of Abernethy's
lectures, which passed comparatively unheeded at the time, or
were swamped in the "getting up" of the requisitions for an examination
at the College, recurred in after days in all their force
and truthfulness. Many, however, with more time, and perhaps
more zeal, endeavoured to thoroughly master his views; and now
and then he was gratified by evidence, that time had only served
to mature the conviction of the pupils&mdash;in dedications and other
complimentary recognitions, in the works of such of them as had
been induced to publish any portion of their own experience.</p>

<p>However various, too, the impressions made by his book,
there are two things certain; viz. that he was much talked of,
and the book had an extensive sale, went through several editions,
and served to give the <i>public</i> some notion of those principles
which he was so beautifully unfolding to the younger portions of
the profession in his lectures. Besides, although there were not
wanting those who spoke disparagingly of him, still, as an old
and very far-seeing colleague of our own used to say, with perhaps
too much truth, when canvassing the various difficulties of
a medical man's progress in the metropolis, "A man had better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
be spoken ill of, than not spoken of at all." He was now beginning
to be very largely consulted. The Public had "got hold
of him," as we once heard a fashionable physician phrase it, and
he soon obtained a large practice. A great many consulted him
for very good reasons, and probably many for little better reason
than that he was the fashion.</p>

<p>Abernethy had now an amount of practice to which neither
he nor any other man could do full justice. Finding it impossible
to make people understand his views in the time usually
allotted for consultation, he now referred his patients to his
book, and especially page 72. This has been made the subject
of a great deal of quizzing, and of something besides, not
altogether quite so good-natured. For our parts, we think it the
most natural thing in the world to refer a patient to a book, which
may contain more in full the principles we desire them to understand,
than we can hope to find opportunity to explain at the
time of consultation. We think that if asking a few questions,
and writing a prescription (and we are here only thinking of a
reasonably fair average time visit), be worth a guinea, the explaining
a principle, or so placing a plan before a patient that his
following it may be assisted and secured, is worth fifty times as
much; and it came particularly well from Abernethy, one of
whose lessons, and a most excellent lesson too, was the remark,
"That if a medical man thought he had done his duty when he
had written a prescription, and a patient regarded his as fulfilled
when he had swallowed it, they were both deceived."</p>

<p>As we are convinced that, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, success in medical
treatment is indefinitely promoted by both patient and surgeon
<i>clearly understanding</i> each other as to <i>principles</i>, we think it would
be of great use if every medical man, who has any definite principles
of practice, were to explain them in short printed digests. Nay,
we have sometimes thought it would be useful to both parties, if,
in addition to the inquiries and advice given at consultation, a
medical man should have brief printed digests of the <i>general</i> nature
and relations of most of the well-defined diseases. A careful
perusal of one of these would help the patients to comprehend the
nature and objects of the advice given, tend to the diffusion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
useful knowledge, and in time help them to understand whether
their treatment were conducted on scientific views, or merely a respectable
sort of empiricism. What is here intended might be
printed on a sheet of note paper; and, whilst it would be of great
service to the patient, would form <i>no bad test of the clearness and
definite principles of the medical attendant</i>. There is no doubt
that Abernethy did good service by referring patients to his book.
It led some to think for themselves, and it also assisted, <i>pro tanto</i>,
in doing away with that absurd idea which supposes something
in medical practice inappreciable by the public.</p>

<p>At this time, whilst, with a considerable indifference to money,
he was making a large income, still he was obliged to work hard
for it. He had as yet no emolument from the Hospital; he was
still only an assistant surgeon. The tenacity of office, of which
assistant surgeons so commonly complain, they have themselves
seldom failed to exercise when they have become surgeons
(Mr. Abernethy, however, excepted). The long tenure of office
by his senior (Sir James Earle) wearied him, and was at times a
source of not very agreeable discussions.</p>

<p>On one occasion, Sir James was reported to have given
Abernethy to understand that, on the occurrence of a certain
event, on which he would obtain an accession of property,
he, Sir James, would certainly resign the surgeoncy of the hospital.
About the time that the event occurred, he happened
one day to call on Abernethy, and was reminded of what he
had been understood to have promised. Sir James, however,
having, we suppose, a different impression of the facts, denied
ever having given such a pledge. The affirmative and negative
were more than once exchanged, and not in the most courteous
manner. When Sir James was going to take his leave, Abernethy
opened the door for him, and, as he had always something
quaint or humorous to close a conversation with, he said, at
parting, "Well, Sir James, it comes to this: you say that you
did not promise to resign the surgeoncy of the hospital; I, on
the contrary, affirm that you did: now all I have to add is,
&mdash;&mdash; the liar!"</p>

<p>In 1813, Abernethy accepted the surgeoncy of Christ's Hospital,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
which he held until 1828, a short time before he retired
from practice.</p>

<p>In 1814, he was appointed Professor of Anatomy and Surgery
to the College of Surgeons&mdash;an appointment which could
be, at this period, of little service to him, whatever lustre it might
reflect on the College, where he gave lectures with a result which
has not always followed on that appointment: namely, of still
adding to his reputation. He was one of the few who addressed
the elders of the profession without impressing the conviction
that he had been too much employed in addressing pupils. He
had given lectures two years in succession, when, in 1816, circumstances
occurred which will occupy us for some little time.
A new scene will be opening upon us; and this suggests the
period (1815–16) as convenient for taking a retrospect, and a
sort of general view of Abernethy's position.</p>

<p>When we look abroad amongst mankind&mdash;nay, even in the
contracted sphere of our own experience&mdash;it is interesting to observe
the varied current of human life in different cases. In
some, from the cradle to the grave, life has been beset with difficulties;
it has been a continued struggle; the breath seems to
have been first drawn, and finally yielded up, amidst the multifarious
oppositions and agitations of adversity. In other instances,
life seems like an easy, smoothly gliding stream, gently
bearing Man on to what had appeared to be the haven of his
wishes; and the little voyage has been begun and completed
without the appearance of a ripple. All varieties are, no doubt,
the result of constantly operating laws. Of these, many are probably
inscrutable by us; many more, no doubt, escape our observation.
The unforeseen nature of many events confers the character
of mystery on any attempt at foresight; yet, when we take
a careful retrospect of a life, it is curious to observe how naturally
the secondary causes appear to have produced the results by
which they were followed; but which, beforehand, no one had
thought of predicting.</p>

<p>Varied, however, as is the course of human life, few men have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
arrived at eminence without difficulty. We do not mean that ephemeral
prominence of "position" which makes them marked in
their day; but that which leaves the impression of their minds
on the age in which they lived, or on the science or other pursuit
which they had chosen&mdash;original minds, who have enlarged the
boundaries of our knowledge. Such men usually have the ample
gifts of nature with which they are endowed, somewhat counterbalanced
by the difficulty experienced in the successful application
of them.</p>

<p>Abernethy had not been altogether exempt from such difficulties.
With a sensitive organization, he had had to make his own
way; he had experienced the difficulties which attend the advocacy
of opinions and principles which were opposed to, or at all
events different from, those generally entertained. He had had
to encounter that misconstruction, misrepresentation, ridicule,
even malice&mdash;save the mark!&mdash;which are too frequently provoked
by any attempts to tell people that there is something more correct
than the notions which they have been accustomed to value.
Still, when we compare Abernethy's course with that of <i>many</i>&mdash;we
had almost said <i>most</i>&mdash;benefactors to science, he might be
said to have been a fortunate man. If a man has power, and a
"place to stand on"&mdash;and Abernethy had both&mdash;truth will tell
at last.</p>

<p>A retired spot, a room in an obscure street, near St. Bartholomew's,
had been by his unaided talents expanded into a theatre
within the walls of the hospital. This was becoming again
crowded; and, although it formed a satisfactory arena for the
development and illustration of his principles, the increasing audiences
were significant of the coming necessity of a still larger
building; which was, in fact, a few years afterwards, constructed.
He had indeed arrived, as we imagine, at a point which was
comparatively smooth water, and which we are inclined to regard
as the zenith of his career.</p>

<p>In the opening of his beautiful lectures at the College, Abernethy,
in one of his warm and earnest endeavours to animate his
audience to regard benevolence, and the love of truth, as the impulses
which could alone urge on, and sustain, industry in cultivating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
the "Science" of our profession, had observed that, "unfortunately,
a man might attain to a considerable share of public
reputation without being a real student of his profession."
There have been indeed too many examples of that, as also of those
who, after years of labour, have failed to obtain a scanty living.</p>

<p>Abernethy had been a real and laborious student in science,
and he was now reaping an abundant and well-deserved fruition.
Few surgeons have arrived at a position so calculated to satisfy
the most exacting ambition. Although the full extent and bearing
of his principles were by no means universally understood, yet
the general importance of them was so, and in some measure appreciated.
In a greater or less degree, they were answering the
tests afforded by the bedside in all parts of the world.</p>

<p>Ample, therefore, as might be the harvest he was reaping in
a large practice, he was enjoying a still higher fruition in the kind
of estimation in which he was held. He had a high reputation
with the public; one still higher amongst men of science. His
crowded waiting-room was a satisfactory evidence of the one, and
the manner in which his name was received here, on the Continent,
and in America, a gratifying testimony of the other. He
was regarded much more in the light of a man of enlarged mind&mdash;a
medical philosopher&mdash;than merely as a distinguished surgeon.</p>

<p>From the very small beginnings left by Mr. Pott, he had
raised the school of St. Bartholomew's to an eminence never before
attained by any school in this country. I think I may say that,
in its <i>peculiar character</i>, it was at that time (1816) unrivalled.</p>

<p>Sir Astley Cooper was in great force and in high repute at
this time; and, combining as he did the schools of <i>two</i> large
hospitals, had, I believe, even a larger class. Both schools, no
doubt, endeavoured to combine what is not, perhaps, very intelligibly
conveyed by the terms practical and scientific; but the
universal impression, assigned the latter as the distinguishing excellence
of Mr. Abernethy, whilst the former was held to express
more happily the characteristic of his eminent contemporary.</p>

<p>Whatever school, however, a London student might have
selected as his Alma Mater, it was very common for those whose
purse, time, or plans permitted it, to attend one or more courses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
of Abernethy's lectures; and it was pleasing to recognize the
graceful concession to Mr. Abernethy's peculiar excellence afforded
by the attendance of some of Sir Astley's pupils, and his since
distinguished relatives, at the lectures of Abernethy.</p>

<p>As I have said, his practice was extensive, and of the most
lucrative kind; that is, it consisted largely of consultations at
home. Still, he had patients to visit, and, as he was very remarkable
for punctuality in all his appointments, was therefore
not unfrequently obliged to leave home before he had seen the
whole of those who had applied to him. The extent of his practice
was the more remarkable, as there was a very general impression,
however exaggerated it might be, that his manners were
unkind and repulsive. His pupils were enthusiastically fond of
him; and it was difficult to know which was the dominant feeling&mdash;their
admiration of his talents, or their personal regard.</p>

<p>Some of the most distinguished men had been of their number;
and it would be gratifying to us to enumerate the very
complimentary catalogue of able men who have been indebted
for much of their eminence and success to the lessons of Abernethy;
but as, in doing so, we might possibly, in our ignorance,
omit some names which ought to be recorded, we forego this
pleasure, lest we should unintentionally appear to neglect any
professional brother whom we ought to have remembered.</p>

<p>In 1812–13, the pupils had presented Mr. Abernethy with a
piece of plate, "as a testimony of their respect and gratitude."
The arrangement of the matter was confided chiefly to the present
Sir James Eyre, Mr. Stowe of Buckingham, and Mr. George
Bullen. In a very interesting letter, with which I have been
favoured by Mr. Stowe, amongst other matters hereafter to be
mentioned, it is stated that the plate was delivered at Abernethy's
house on the 1st of April; and as he had no more entirely escaped
such things than other medical men, he at first regarded it as a
hoax. But when the contents were exposed, and he discovered
the truth, he became much affected.</p>

<p>The regard of the pupils was always the thing nearest his
heart. On meeting the class at the hospital, he essayed to express
his feelings; but finding that he should only break down, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
adopted the same course as he had employed on another memorable
occasion, and <i>wrote</i> his acknowledgments, a copy of which
was suspended against the wall of the theatre.</p>

<p>It is due to our worthy and kind-hearted contemporary, Sir
James Eyre, to add that Mr. Stowe observes in his letter, that, of
all others, Sir James was the most zealous promoter of a movement
so creditable to all parties. Some years after this, another
subscription was commenced by the pupils for a portrait of Abernethy,
which was painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence, and engraved
by Bromley. It was after this engraving that Mr. Cook executed
the portrait which forms the frontispiece of the present volume.
Sir Thomas, and the engraver after him, have been most successful.
He has caught one of Mr. Abernethy's most characteristic expressions.
We see him as he often stood when addressing the
<i>anatomical</i> class. We think it impossible to combine more of
of him in one view. We fancy we see his acute penetration, his
thoughtful expression, his archness and humour, and his benevolence,
all most happily delineated, whilst the general position
and manner is eminently faithful. In his surgical lectures, he
was generally seated; and in the lithograph, he is represented in
the position which he almost invariably assumed when he was
enunciating the proposition which is placed beneath the engraving.
It is the work of a young artist who was considered to
evince great promise of future excellence; but who, we regret to
say, died last year&mdash;Mr. Leighton.</p>

<p>In 1815, he had been appointed surgeon to the hospital, after
twenty-eight years' tenure of the assistant surgeoncy; a subject
that we merely mention now, as we shall be obliged to revert to
it when we consider the subject of the "Hospital System."</p>

<p>At the time to which we allude, lecturing had become so easy
as to appear little more than amusement to him; yet there were
(we speak of about 1816) no signs of neglect or forgetfulness.
His own interest in the subject was sustained throughout; but
as his unrivalled lecturing will be more fully described, we must
not anticipate. Few old pupils visited London without contriving
to get to the hospital at lecture time. The drudgery of
the early morning anatomical demonstration was taken off his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
hands by a gentleman who performed his task with credit to
himself and with justice to his pupils.</p>

<p>Abernethy, at this time, in addition to a successful school, a
large and attached class, a solid and world-wide reputation, was
receiving numerous proofs that his principles were recognized;
that, however imperfectly adopted, they were gaining ground; and
that if all his suggestions were not universally admitted, they
were becoming axiomatic with some of the first surgeons, both in
this and other countries.</p>

<p>We think it not improbable that it was somewhere about this
period that it was proposed to confer on him the honour of a
Baronetcy. We had long been familiar with the fact; but not
regarding it as very important, and having nothing in proof of it
but the generally received impression, we omitted any reference
to it in the first edition of these Memoirs. Finding, however,
more interest attached to the circumstance than we expected, we
have communicated with the family on the subject, and have
ascertained that all the circumstances are fresh in their recollection,
although they cannot recall the exact period at which they
occurred.</p>

<p>His first announcement of the fact to his family was at table,
by his jocosely saying: "Lady Abernethy, will you allow me to
assist you to&mdash;?" &amp;c. Having had his joke, he then formally
announced to them the fact, together with the reasons which had
induced him to decline the proffered honour&mdash;namely, that he did
not consider his fortune sufficient, after having made what he
regarded as only a necessary provision for his family.</p>

<p>It is probable that his motives were of a mixed character.
We do not believe that he attached much value to this kind of
distinction, and that, had he availed himself of the offer, it would
have been rather from a kind of deference to the recognition it
afforded of the claims, and thus indirectly promoting the cultivation
of Science, than for any other reason. It was not but that
he held rank and station in the respect which is justly due to
them; but that he regarded titles as no very certain tests of
scientific distinction. Enthusiastic in his admiration of intellectual,
still more of moral excellence, he had something scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
less than coldness in regard to the value of mere titles; whilst he
beheld, with something like repulsion, the flattery to which their
possessors were so often exposed.</p>

<p>There are men who have so individualized themselves that they
seem to obscure their identity by any new title. John Hunter
was scarcely known by any less simple appellation. We hardly
now say "<i>Mr.</i>" Hunter without feeling that we may be misunderstood.
It begins to have a sound like "Mr." Milton or "Mr."
Shakspeare; Abernethy and John Abernethy are fast becoming
the only recognized designations of our philosophical surgeon, for
even the modest prefix of <i>Mr.</i> is fast going into disuse. Be this
as it may, it is certain he declined the honour; and to us it is
equally so that he felt at least indifferent to it; for although the
good sense and good feeling implied in the reasons alleged were
characteristic, yet, had they constituted the only motive, he might,
with his abundant opportunities, have removed that objection in
a very reasonable time, without difficulty.</p>

<p>It is perhaps significant of the measured interest with which
Mr. Abernethy regarded the acquisition of a Baronetcy, that
the family could not recollect the period at which it was offered.
This information, however, I obtained from Sir Benjamin Brodie,
who has kindly allowed me to record the fact in the following
reply to my inquiry on the subject.</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="sigright in0">"14, Saville Row,<br />
"November 16, 1854.</p>

<p class="sigleft in0">"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"My answer to your inquiry may be given in a very few
words. I perfectly well remember the having been informed
by the late Sir John Becket that he had been commissioned by
Lord Liverpool to offer Mr. Abernethy, on the part of the
Crown, the honor of being created a Baronet, which, however,
Mr. Abernethy declined.</p>

<p class="sigright in0">"I am, dear <span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;<br />
"Yours faithfully,&#8195;<br />

</blockquote>


          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<p>He told me once of an interview he had with Lord Castlereagh,
which may, perhaps, be not out of place here. When Sir
T. Lawrence was painting the portrait, and Abernethy went to
give him a sitting, Abernethy was shown into a room where
another visitor, a stranger to him, was also waiting. The stranger,
looking at a portrait of the Duke of York, observed, "Very well
painted, and very like." "Very well painted," Abernethy replied.
The other rejoined: "A good picture, and an excellent likeness."
"A very good picture," said Abernethy. "And an excellent
likeness," again rejoined his companion. "Why, the fact is,"
said Abernethy, "Sir Thomas has lived so much amongst the
great, that he has learnt to flatter them most abominably." On
being shown in to Sir Thomas, Sir Thomas said: "I find you
have been talking to Lord Castlereagh."</p>

<p>He had not, we think, as yet sustained the loss of any member
of his family, nor hardly experienced any of those ordinary crosses
from which few men's lives are free, and which, sooner or later,
seldom fail to strew our paths with enough to convince us that
perfect peace cannot be auspiciously sought in the conduct of
human affairs. He was soon, however, to receive an impression
of a painful nature, and from a quarter whence, whatever might
have been his experience, he certainly little expected it. Long
accustomed to be listened to by admiring and assenting audiences,
whether in the theatre of the hospital, or in those clusters of
pupils which never failed to crowd around him whenever he had
anything to say; he was now to have some of his opinions disputed,
his mode of advocating them impugned, his views of "Life,"
made the subject of ridicule, and even his fair dealing in argument
called in question. All this, too, by no stranger; no person
known only to him as one of the public, but by one who had
been his pupil, whose talents he had helped to mature and develop,
whose progress and prospects in life he had fostered and improved,
and to whom, as was affirmed by the one, and attested by the
other, he had been a constant friend.</p>

<p>That this controversy was the source of much suffering to
Abernethy, we are compelled to believe; and it is altogether to
us so disagreeable, and difficult a subject, that we should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
preferred confining ourselves to a bare mention of it, and a reference
to the works wherein the details might be found; it is,
however, too important an episode in the life of Abernethy to be
so passed over; it suggests many interesting reflections; it exhibits
Abernethy in a new phase, illustrates, under very trying
circumstances, the</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>"Time, which obliterates the fictions of opinion, confirms the decisions of

</blockquote>


<p>Whoever has wandered to the south side of Lincoln's Inn
Fields, will have found himself in one of the "solitudes of London"&mdash;one
of those places which, interspersed here and there amidst
the busy current that rushes along every street and ally, seem
quite out of the human life-tide, and furnish serene spots, a
dead calm, in the midst of tumult and agitation. Here a lawyer
may con over a "glorious uncertainty," a surgeon a difficult case,
a mathematician the general doctrine of probability, or the Chevalier
d'Industrie the particular case of the <i>habitat</i> of his next
dinner; but, unless you have some such need of abstraction from
the world, these places are heart-sinkingly dull. You see few
people; perhaps there may be a sallow-looking gentleman, in a
black coat, with a handful of papers, rushing into "chambers;"
or a somewhat more rubicund one in blue, walking seriously out:
the very stones are remarkably round and salient, as if from want,
rather than from excess, of friction. The atmosphere from the
distance comes charged with the half-spent, booming hum of
population.</p>

<p>Immediately around you, all is comparatively silent.</p>

<p>If you are in a carriage, it seems every moment to come in
contact with fresh surfaces, and "beats a roll" of continued vibrations;
or, if a carriage happen to pass you, it seems to make
more noise than half a dozen vehicles anywhere else. You may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
observe a long façade, of irregular elevations&mdash;upright parallelograms,
called habitable houses; but, for aught you see, half of
them may have been deserted: the dull sameness of the façade is
broken only by half a dozen Ionic columns, which, notwithstanding
their number, seem very serious and very solitary. You may,
perhaps, imagine that they bear a somewhat equivocal relation to
the large house before which they stand. You may fancy them
to be architectural relics, inconveniently large for admission to
some depository within, or that they are intended as a sort of
respectable garniture to the very plain house which they partly
serve to conceal or embellish; or quiz them as you please, for
architects cannot do everything, nor at once convert a very ugly
house into a very beautiful temple.</p>

<p>But, stop there!&mdash;for temple it is&mdash;ay, perhaps, as human
temples always are, not altogether unprofaned; but not so desecrated,
we trust, but that it may yet contain the elements of its
own purification. It enshrines, reader, a gem of great value,
which nothing extrinsic can improve, which no mere art can embellish&mdash;a
treasure gathered from the ample fields of nature, and
which can be enriched or adorned only from the same exhaustless
store. Though humble, indeed, the tenement, yet, were it
humbler still, though it were composed of reeds, and covered in
with straw, it would remain hallowed to science.</p>

<p>It holds the monument of the untiring labour of a great
master&mdash;the rich garnerings of a single mind&mdash;the record, alas!
but of <i>some</i> of the obligations mankind owe to the faithful pioneer
of a Science which, however now partially merged in clouds and
darkness, and obscured by error, still exhibits through the gloom,
enough to assert its lofty original, and to foster hopes of better
times.</p>

<p>The museum of John Hunter (for it is of that we write) is
one of the greatest labours ever achieved by a single individual.
To estimate that labour aright, to arrive at a correct notion of
the man, the spectator should disregard the number of preparations&mdash;the
mass of mechanical and manipulatory labour which is
involved&mdash;the toil, in fact, of mere collection; and, looking
through that, contemplate the <i>thought</i> which it records; the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
nature of the plan; the manner in which the Argus-eyed
Author has assembled together various processes in the vegetable
creation; how he has associated them with their nearest relations
in the animal kingdom; and how he has traced the chain from
link to link, from the more simple to the more compounded forms,
so as to throw light on the laws dispensed to Man. The spectator
should then think of the Hunterian portion of the museum as the
exhausting harvest of half a life, blessed with no greatly lengthened
days; a museum gathered not in peaceful seasons of leisure,
nor amid the ease of undiverted thought, but amidst the interrupting
agitations of a populous city&mdash;the persistent embarrassments
of measured means&mdash;the multiform distractions of an arduous
profession&mdash;the still more serious interruptions of occasional indisposition&mdash;and,
finally, amidst annoyances from quarters whence
he had every right to expect support and sympathy&mdash;annoyances
which served no other purpose but to embitter the tenure of life,
and to hasten its termination.</p>

<p>Our space will not allow us to dwell more on this subject
or the Museum just now. But where is our excellent conservator&mdash;where
is Mr. Clift, the assistant, the friend, and young companion
of John Hunter? He, too, is gathered to his rest. He,
on whose countenance benevolence had impressed a life-long
smile&mdash;he who used to tell us, as boys, so much of all he knew,
and to remind us, as men, how much we were in danger of forgetting&mdash;is
now no more. How kind and communicative he was;
how modest, and yet how full of information; how acceptably the
cheerfulness of social feelings mantled over the staid gravity of
science. How fond of any little pleasant story to vary the round
of conservative exposition; and then, if half a dozen of us were
going round with him the "<i>con</i>ticuere omnes," when, with his
characteristic prefatory shrug, he was about to speak of Hunter.
Then such a memory! Why once, in a long delightful chat, we
were talking over the Lectures at the College, and he ran over
the general objects of various courses, during a succession of years,
with an accuracy which, if judged of by those which had fallen
within our own recollection, might have suggested that he had
carried a syllabus of each in his pocket.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>We had much to say of Mr. Clift; but, in these times of
speed, there is hardly time for anything; yet we think that many
an old student, when he has lingered over the stately pile reared
by John Hunter, may have paused and felt his eyes moistened by
the memory of William Clift.</p>

<p>When Mr. Abernethy lectured at the College, there was no
permanent professor, as is now the case; no Professor Owen, of
whom we shall have to speak more in the sequel. Both the professorship
of anatomy and surgery, and also that of comparative
anatomy, were only held for a comparatively short time.</p>

<p>It is not very easy to state the principle on which the professors
were selected. The privilege of addressing the seniors of
the profession has never, any more than any other appointment
in the profession, been the subject of public competition; nor,
unless the Council have had less penetration than we are disposed
to give them credit for, has "special fitness" been a very dominant
principle. Considering the respectability and position of the
gentlemen who have been selected, the Lectures at the College
of Surgeons, under the arrangements we are recording, were certainly
much less productive, as regards any improvement in
science, than might have been reasonably expected.</p>

<p>The vice of "system" could not be always, however, corrected
by the merits of the individual. One result, which too commonly
arose out of it, was, that gentlemen were called on to address
their seniors and contemporaries for the first time, who had never
before addressed any but pupils. It would not, therefore, have
been very wonderful, if, amongst the other difficulties of lecturing,
that most inconvenient one of all should have sometimes occurred,
of having nothing to say.</p>

<p>Mr. Abernethy was appointed in 1814, and had the rare
success of conferring a lustre on the appointment, and the perhaps
still more difficult task of sustaining, before his seniors and contemporaries,
that unrivalled reputation as a lecturer which he had
previously acquired. As Mr. Abernethy had been all his life
teaching a more scientific surgery, which he believed to be founded
on principles legitimately deducible from facts developed by
Hunter; so every circumstance of time, place, and inclination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
disposed him to bring Mr. Hunter's views and opinions under the
review of the audience at the College, composed of his seniors,
his contemporaries, and of pupils from the different schools. He
was, we believe, equally desirous of disseminating them amongst
the one class, and of having them considered by the others. At
this time, no lectures of Mr. Hunter had been published; and
Mr. Abernethy thought that, <i>to understand</i> Hunter's opinions of
the <i>actions</i> of living bodies, it was expedient that people should
have some notion of what Mr. Hunter considered to be the general
nature of&mdash;"Life."</p>

<p>We hold this point to be very important; for all experience
shows that speculation on the abstract nature of things is to the
last degree unprofitable. Nothing is so clear in all sciences as
that the proper study of mankind is the Laws by which they are
governed. Yet we cannot, in any science, proceed without something
to give an intelligible expression to our ideas; which <i>something</i>
is essentially hypothetical.</p>

<p>If, for example, we speak of light, we can hardly express our
ideas without first supposing of light that it is some subtle substance
sent off from luminous bodies, or that it consists in undulations;
as we adopt the corpuscular or undulatory theory. It
would be easy to form a third, somewhat different from either,
and which would yet pretend to no more than to give a still more
intelligible expression to phenomena.</p>

<p>Now this is, as it appears to us, just what Mr. Abernethy did.
He did not speculate on the nature of life for any other reason
than to give a more intelligible expression to Mr. Hunter's other
views. At that time there was nothing <i>published</i>, showing that
Mr. Hunter's ideas of life were what Mr. Abernethy represented
them to be; they might have been remembered by men of his
own age, but this was not very good for controversy; and as that
was made a point of attack<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor"><sup>35</sup></a>, it is well that the since collected
"Life and Lectures of John Hunter," by Mr. Palmer, have given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
us a written authority for the accuracy of Abernethy's representations.</p>

<p>In theorizing on the cause of the phenomena of living bodies,
men have, at different times, arrived at various opinions; but
although not so understood, it seems to us that they all merge
into two&mdash;the one which supposes Life to be the result of organization,
or the arrangement of matter; the other, that the organization
given, Life is something superadded to it; just as electricity
or magnetism to the bodies with which these forces may be
connected. The latter was the opinion which Mr. Abernethy
advocated as that held by Mr. Hunter, and which he honestly
entertained as most intelligibly and rationally, in his view, explaining
the phenomena.</p>

<p>That such were really the views held by Mr. Hunter, a few
passages from the work, as published by Mr. Palmer, will show.
"Animal and vegetable substances," says Mr. Hunter, "differ from
common matter in having a power superadded totally different
from any other known property of matter; out of which various
new properties arise<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor"><sup>36</sup></a>." So much for a general view. Next, a
reference to particular powers: "Actions in animal bodies have
been so much considered under a chemical and mechanical
philosophy, that physiologists have entirely lost sight of Life;"
again showing how correctly Abernethy had interpreted Hunter's
notion of the necessary "Key," as Abernethy phrased it, to his
views; Hunter says: "For unless we consider Life as the immediate
cause of attraction occurring in animals and vegetables,
we can <i>have no just conception</i> of animal and vegetable matter<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor"><sup>37</sup></a>."
Mr. Hunter, in relation to the idea of life being the result of
organization, shows how faithful an exposition Abernethy had
given of his views. "It appears," says he, "that the Living
Principle cannot arise from the peculiar modification of matter,
because the same modification exists where this principle is no
more."&mdash;Vol. i, p. 221. And in the same page: "Life, then,
appears to be something superadded to this peculiar modification
of matter."</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>

<p>Then as to one of the illustrations employed by Abernethy,
Hunter, after saying that he is aware that it is difficult to conceive
this superaddition, adds: "But to show that matter may take
on new properties without being altered itself as to the species
of matter, it may not be improper to illustrate this. Perhaps
magnetism affords the best illustration. A bar of iron, without
magnetism, may be considered as animal matter without life.
With magnetism, it acquires new properties of attraction and
repulsion," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Mr. Abernethy, as we have said, advocated similar views;
and, we repeat, founded his reason for so doing on what he conceived
to be the necessity of explaining Mr. Hunter's ideas of life,
<i>before he could render</i> his (Hunter's) <i>explanation</i> of the various
phenomena intelligible. In all of this, he certainly was expressing
Mr. Hunter's own views, with that talent for ornamenting and
illustrating everything he discussed, for which he was so remarkable.</p>

<p>Abernethy multiplied the illustrations by showing the various
analogies which seemed to him to be presented in the velocity,
the chemical, and other powers of Life and Electricity; and, with
especial reference to the extraordinary discoveries of Sir Humphrey
Davy, added such illustrations, as more recent achievements in
chemical science had placed within his grasp; and thence concluding
it as evident that some subtile, mobile, invisible substance
seemed to pervade all nature, so it was not unreasonable to suppose
that some similar substance or power pervaded animal bodies.
He guarded himself, however, both in his first and again in his
second Course of Lectures, from being supposed to identify Life
with electricity, in a long paragraph especially devoted to that
object. In his second Course, in 1815, he proceeded to enumerate
John Hunter's various labours and contributions to science,
as shown by the Museum; imparting great interest to every
subject, and in so popular a form, that we wonder now, when
(as we rejoice to see) there are some small beginnings of a
popularization of physiology, that there is not a cheap reprint of
these Lectures.</p>

<p>Keeping, then, his object in view, we cannot see how, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
faithful interpreter of John Hunter, Abernethy could have done
less; and if any theory of life at all is to be adopted, as <i>necessary
to give an intelligible impression</i> to phenomena, one can hardly
quarrel with that which takes the phenomena of life on one hand,
and those of death on the other, as the means of expressing our
ideas. When we see a man dead, whom we had contemplated
alive, it certainly seems that something has left him; and whether
we say "something superadded,"&mdash;the "breath" or "Life," or by
whatever term we call it,&mdash;we appear really to express in as simple
a form as possible the facts before us. It seems to us that, after
all, John Hunter did little more; for the illustration or similitude
by which we endeavour to render an idea clear, has in strictness
nothing <i>necessarily</i> to do with the idea itself; any more than an
analogy, however real the likeness, or a parallelism, however close,
represents identity.</p>

<p>We should have thought it, therefore, of all things in the world
the least likely that a representation of any theory of Hunter's
should have disturbed the harmony which ought to exist between
men engaged in scientific inquiries. It shows, however, the value
of confining ourselves as strictly as possible to phenomena, and the
conclusions deducible from them. Nothing could possibly be more
philosophical than the terms in which Mr. Abernethy undertook to
advocate Mr. Hunter's views of life. His definitions of hypothesis,
the conditions on which he founded its legitimate character,
the modesty with which he applies it, and the clearness with
which he states how easily our best-grounded suppositions may be
subverted by new facts, are very lucid and beautiful, and give a
tone to the lectures (as we should have thought) the very last
calculated to have led to the consequences which followed.</p>

<p>No man, perhaps, ever made a happier application of a Divine
precept to the conduct of human pursuits than Lord Bacon, when
he said that the kingdom of man founded in the sciences must
be entered like the kingdom of God&mdash;that is, as a little child.</p>

<p>Independently of the sublimity of the comparison, it is no
less remarkable for its practical excellence.</p>

<p>How many broken friendships, enmities, and heart-burnings
might have been prevented, had even a very moderate degree of
the temper of mind here so beautifully typified been allowed to
preside over human labour! How charitably should we have been
led to judge of the works of others! how measured the approbation
of the most successful of our own! No doubt, in the
pursuit of truth, there is great difficulty in commanding that combination
of fearlessness towards the world, and that reverential
humility towards the subject, both of which are alike necessary;
although the one may be more essential to the <i>discovery</i> of truth,
the other the <i>enunciation</i> of it.</p>

<p>To pursue truth regardless of the multiform errors and conventionalisms,
amidst which experience has generally shown almost
all subjects to have been involved; unmindful of the rebukes and
obloquy by which too often the best-conducted investigations are
opposed and assailed; and yet to let no angry passion stir, no
conviction that we are right engender an improper idea of our
own superiority, or a disregard for the claims of others; this
overcoming of the world (we had almost said) is intensely difficult,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
for it is in fact overcoming ourselves. Yet we dare not say it is
that of which human nature is incapable, for there is nothing that
the heart suggests as morally right which is really impossible to
us; and instances have not been wanting of the combination of
the deepest knowledge with the most profound humility.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it must be admitted that if there were
anything especially calculated to bring down the cultivators of
science and literature to the level of those who are regardless of
the claims, or insensible to the attractions of either; we could
hardly find a series of facts more fatally influential than are
furnished by the disputes of men who have been employed in the
cultivation of these elevating studies. Powerful intellects in
teaching the comparative nothingness of man's knowledge seem
to give great assistance in the acquisition of humility; but how
few are the intellects of such power? The contemplation of
nature, however, may, we conceive, infuse <i>feelings</i> of humility,
which can rarely be attained by the efforts of intellect alone.</p>

<p>We have seen, in Lord Bacon, that the highest powers of
intellect afforded for a while no security against the subtle, but
one would have thought feeble, suggestions of a degrading cupidity.
We all know, in literature, how much the fruits of intellect depend
on the dominant feeling under which they are reared and nourished.
Even men like Pope and Addison, who had little in common but
that which should elevate and adorn human nature, were so
dragged down by the demon of controversy, that, commencing
with little more than the irritability of poets, they ceased
only when they had forgotten even the language of gentlemen.
In the controversy in question, Mr. Abernethy's position was a
very difficult one, and one which shows how easily a man with the
best intentions may find himself engaged in a discussion which
he never contemplated; be wounded on points on which he was
most sensitive, and yet defend himself with dignity, and without
compromise of any of those principles which should guide a
gentleman and a Christian.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawrence was appointed Professor of Comparative Anatomy
in 1816; and we know that Mr. Abernethy hailed his
appointment with considerable interest. He was regarded as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
gentleman of some promise, and had already distinguished himself
by a singularly nice, level style of composition, as well as by
careful compilation.</p>

<p>Nothing could seem more auspicious than such a prospect.
Mr. Abernethy was a man remarkable for the original view he
took of most subjects; a vast experience, gathered from various
sources by a mind combining vividly perceptive powers with great
capacity for reflection, a conformation well adapted for opening
out <i>new paths, and extending the boundaries of science</i>. Abernethy
was now to be associated with a colleague who had already
manifested no ordinary talent for the graceful and judicious exposition
of what <i>was already known</i>.</p>

<p>Nothing could have seemed more promising; nor was there
anything in the opening of Mr. Lawrence's first lecture which
seemed calculated to baulk these expectations. His exordium
contained an appropriate recognition of Mr. Abernethy, which,
as we should only mar it by extract, we give entire. Having
referred to the circumstances which immediately preceded his appointment,
Mr. Lawrence thus proceeds:</p>

<p>"To your feelings I must trust for an excuse, if any be
thought necessary, for taking the earliest opportunity of giving
utterance to the sentiments of respect and gratitude I entertain
for the latter gentleman (Mr. Abernethy). You and the public
know, and have long known, his acute mind, his peculiar talent
for observation, his zeal for the advancement of surgery, and
his successful exertions in improving the scientific knowledge
and treatment of disease; his singular happiness in developing
and teaching to others the original and philosophic views which
he naturally takes of all subjects that come under his examination,
and the success with which he communicates that enthusiasm
in the cause of science and humanity which is so warmly
felt by himself; the admirable skill with which he enlivens the
dry details of elementary instruction are most gratefully acknowledged
by his numerous pupils.</p>

<p>"All these sources of excellence have been repeatedly felt in
this theatre. Having had the good fortune to be initiated in
the profession by Mr. Abernethy, and to have lived for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
years under his roof, I can assure you, with the greatest sincerity,
that however highly the public may estimate the surgeon
and philosopher, I have reason to speak still more highly of the
man and of the friend, of the invariable kindness which directed
my early studies and pursuits, and the disinterested friendship
which has assisted every step of my progress in life, the independent
spirit and the liberal conduct which, while they dignify
the profession, win our love, command our respect for genius
and knowledge, converting these precious gifts into instruments
of the most extensive public good<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor"><sup>38</sup></a>."</p>

<p>This graceful exordium, so appropriate to the mutual relations
of Mr. Abernethy and Mr. Lawrence, deriving, too, a peculiar
interest from the circumstances under which it was delivered,
had also the rare merit of an eulogium marked by a comprehensive
fidelity. There is nothing fulsome or overstrained. Mr.
Abernethy's well-known excellences were touchingly adverted to
as matters with which all were <i>in common</i> familiar, whilst the
necessarily more special facts of his social virtues were judiciously
brought out in just relief, and as an appropriate climax, by one
who appeared animated by a grateful and personal experience of
them. It is distressing to think that anything should have followed
otherwise than in harmony with that kindness and benevolence
which, whilst it forms the most auspicious tone for the calm pursuits
of philosophy, confers on them the purifying spirit of practical
Christianity.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawrence's first lecture consisted mainly of an able and
interesting <i>exposé</i> of the objects and advantages of Comparative
Anatomy to the physiologist, pathologist, medical man, and the
theologian; together with numerous references to those authors
to whom the science was most indebted. The second lecture was
devoted to the consideration and the discussion of various views
which had been entertained of the living principle, or by whatever
name we may designate that force which is the immediate cause
of the phenomena of Living Bodies.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<p>Amongst others, those entertained by Mr. Hunter and advocated
by Mr. Abernethy were referred to; but in a tone which
was not, perhaps, best suited to promote calm discussion, and
which we may be allowed to say was unfortunate&mdash;a tone of ridicule
and banter, which was hardly suited either to the subject, the
place, or the distinguished men to whom it related; to say the
least of it, it was unnecessary. We do not quote these passages,
because they are, we think, not necessary to the narrative, and
could, we think, now give no pleasure to any party<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor"><sup>39</sup></a>.</p>

<p>In Mr. Abernethy's next lecture at the College, he still advocated
the rational nature of Mr. Hunter's views of Life; and,
in a most interesting exposition of the Gallery of the Museum,
opposed at every opportunity the views of certain French physiologists
which Mr. Lawrence had adopted.</p>

<p>He did this, however, without naming Mr. Lawrence; and
applied his remarks to the whole of those who had advocated the
opinions that Life was the result of organization, as a "Band of
modern sceptics."</p>

<p>Mr. Abernethy had, as he says, argued against a party, and
studiously kept Mr. Lawrence, as an individual, out of view.
He, however, argued roundly against the views advocated by him,
and endeavoured to show that those of Mr. Hunter, besides being
at least a philosophical explanation of the phenomena, had a good
moral tendency; although he admitted that the belief that man
was a mere machine did not alter established notions, and that
there were many good sceptics, still he thought that the "belief
of the distinct and independent nature of mind incited people
to act rightly," &amp;c.</p>

<p>In regard to the general influence of the state of France, he
says, "Most people think and act with a party;" and that "in
France, where the writings of the philosophers and wits had
greatly tended to demoralize the people, he was not surprised
that their anatomists and physiologists should represent the
subject of their studies in a manner conformable to what is
esteemed most philosophical and clever; but that in this country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
the mere opinions of some French anatomists with respect to the
nature of life should be extracted from their general writings,
translated, and extolled, cannot but excite surprise and indignation
in any one apprized of their pernicious tendency."</p>

<p>There is no doubt that there was at the time, in this country,
a disposition in many people to disseminate very many opinions
on various subjects different from those usually entertained; and
we believe that this disposition was very greatly increased by the
well-intentioned, no doubt, but in our view injudicious, means
employed for the suppression of them.</p>

<p>We think it important to remember this; because, in estimating
fairly any books or lectures, we must regard the spirit of the
time in which they were delivered&mdash;what would be judicious or
necessary at one period, being, of course, unnecessary or injudicious
at another.</p>

<p>In relation to the opinions of the nature of life; that which
Mr. Abernethy alleged that he intended to apply to a party, Mr.
Lawrence alleged that he held as personally applying to himself.
Accordingly, the following course of Mr. Lawrence's lectures
commenced with "A Reply to the 'Charges' of Mr. Abernethy."
This lecture, which it is impossible for any man, mindful of all
the circumstances, to peruse without pain (especially if we include
the notes), is couched in language of the most vituperative and
contemptuous character: sarcasm, ridicule, imputation of corrupt
motives, by turn, are the weapons wielded with the appearance of
the most unrelenting virulence.</p>

<p>Those of the audience who had heard the graceful exordium,
which we have quoted, to the first course of lectures, and which
so appropriately represented a just tribute to a great master and
kind friend, from a distinguished and favoured pupil, were now
to listen to a discourse which was so charged with various shades
and descriptions of ridicule and invective, as scarcely to be paralleled
in the whole history of literary or scientific controversy. We
have recently again perused the respective Lectures, and we are
utterly at a loss to understand how the most sensitive mind could
have found anything in Mr. Abernethy's Lectures to call for such
a "Reply." As it appears to us, its very virulence was calculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
to weaken its force, and to enlist the sympathies of people
on the opposite side. We again forbear quotation. All we
have to do is to show that circumstances of very unusual provocation,
such as no man living could help feeling most deeply,
and which bore on one who was acutely sensitive, never materially
disturbed the native benevolence of Abernethy's disposition.</p>

<p>The dispute, however, soon merged into matters which the
public regarded as more important. Mr. Lawrence, in the lectures
which followed, took occasion to make some remarks on the
Scriptures, which gave great offence, and led other writers to
engage in a controversy which now assumed more of a theological
than a physiological character. This, however, rather belongs to
the writings and opinions of Mr. Lawrence, than to the life of
Abernethy. We will therefore at once offer the very few observations
which we alone think it necessary to make, either in justice
to Mr. Abernethy or the profession.</p>

<p>In reviewing the facts of the foregoing controversy, we are
anxious to restrict our remarks to such points as fall within the
proper scope of our present object. These appear to us to relate
to the mode in which Mr. Abernethy conducted his argument, as
being legitimate or otherwise; secondly, the influence the whole
affair had in developing one of the most important features in his
character; and, lastly, the impression it produced, for good or
evil, on the public mind, in relation to our profession.</p>

<p>We would observe, in the first place, that the difficulty of
Mr. Abernethy's position was very painful and peculiar. We are
not learned in controversy; but we should imagine that position
to have been almost without parallel. Mr. Lawrence had been
his pupil. As we have seen, Mr. Abernethy had been his patron
and his friend; and, moreover, he had been not a little instrumental
in placing Mr. Lawrence in the Professor's chair. This
instrumentality could not have been merely passive. Mr. Abernethy
himself was not a senior of the Council at that time. At all
events, he was associated at the College with men much older
than himself, and must have owed any influence in the appointment
to an active expression of his wishes, supported by that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
attention to them which, though not necessarily connected with
his standing at the College, was readily enough, no doubt, conceded
to his talents and his reputation. His singleness of mind
in this business was the more amiable, because, had he been disposed
to be inactive, there were not wanting circumstances which
might not unnaturally have induced some hesitation on the subject.
In the postscript at the end of Mr. Abernethy's published
Lectures, delivered at the College, we learn that, "From an early
period of his studies, Mr. Lawrence had been accustomed to
decry and scoff at what I taught as Mr. Hunter's opinions respecting
life and its functions; yet," he adds, "as I never could
find that he had any good reason for his conduct, I continued
to teach them in the midst of the controversy, and derision of
such students as had become his proselytes," &amp;c.</p>

<p>This could hardly have been very agreeable. The pupils
were wont to discuss most subjects in their gossips in the Square
of the hospital, or elsewhere; and many a careless hour has not
been unprofitably so employed. On such occasions, those who
were so inclined would no doubt use ridicule, or any other weapon
that suited their purpose; and so long as any reasonable limits
were observed, Mr. Abernethy was the last person likely to take
notice of anything which might have reached him on the subject.
On the contrary, it was his excellence, and his often-expressed
wish that we should canvass every subject for ourselves; and he
would enforce the sincerity of his recommendation by advising us
with an often-repeated quotation:</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="in0">"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri</span>."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Still, we cannot conceive that the desultory discussions at the
hospital, of which he might from time to time have accidentally
heard, could have prepared him to expect that a similar tone was
to form any portion of the sustained compositions of Lectures to
be delivered in Lincoln's Inn Fields. When, however, he found
his opinions ridiculed there, by his friend and pupil, what was to
be done? Was he to enter into a direct personal sort of controversy
with his colleague in office at the College of Surgeons?</p>

<p>There was everything in that course that was inexpedient and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
repulsive. Was he to be silent on opinions which he <i>knew</i> to
have been Mr. Hunter's, and of the moral and scientific advantages
of which he had a most matured conviction? That would have
been a compromise of his duty. It was a difficult dilemma&mdash;a
real case of the</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="in0">"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Incidit in Scyllam qui vult vitare Charybdim</span>."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>If he avoided one difficulty, he fell into another. He tried to
take a middle course&mdash;he argued in support of the opinions he
had enunciated, and aided these by additional illustrations; and,
in contrasting them with those opinions which were opposed to
him, he endeavoured to avoid a personal allusion to individuals,
by arguing against a class, which he termed the "band of modern
sceptics." Even this was a little Charybdis, perhaps; because it
had a sort of name-calling effect, whilst it was not at all essential
thus to embody in any one phrase the persons who held opposite
opinions.</p>

<p>His position was intensely difficult. It should be recollected
that Abernethy had always been a teacher of young men; that he
had <i>always</i> taught principles of surgery which he conceived to be
deducible from those delivered by Hunter; that he further believed
that, to understand Hunter clearly, it was necessary to
have a correct notion of the idea Mr. Hunter entertained of
"Life;" and lastly, that, in <i>all</i> his Lectures, Abernethy had a
constant tendency to consider, and a habit of frequent appeal to,
what, under different forms, might be regarded as the moral bearings
of any subject which might be under discussion. We readily
admit that, usually, in conducting scientific <i>arguments</i>, the alleged
moral tendencies of this or that view are more acceptable when
reserved to grace a conclusion, than when employed to enforce an
argument; yet we think that, now, comparatively few persons
would think the discussion of any subject bearing on the physical
nature of Man, complete, which omitted the very intimate and
demonstrable relations which exist between the moral and the
physiological laws.</p>

<p>The point, however, which we wish to impress, is, that Mr.
Abernethy, in pleading the moral bearings of Hunter's views by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
deductions of his own, was simply following that course which he
<i>had been in the habit</i> of doing on most other questions; it was
merely part of that plan on which, without the smallest approach
at any attempt to intrude religious considerations inappropriately
into the discussion of matters ordinarily regarded as secular, he
had always inculcated a straightforward, free-from-cant, do-as-you-would-be-done-by
tone in his own Lectures. This, while it
formed one of their brightest ornaments, was just that without
which all lectures must be held as defective, which are addressed
to young men about to enter an arduous and responsible profession.</p>

<p>Abernethy stated nothing as facts but which were demonstrably
such; and with regard to any hypotheses which he employed in
aid of explaining them, he observed those conditions which philosophers
agree on as necessary, whether the hypotheses be adopted
or otherwise. He did not do even this, but for the very legitimate
object of explaining the views of the man on whose labours
he was discoursing.</p>

<p>When those views of Mr. Hunter, which had been thus set
forth and illustrated, were attacked, he defended them with his
characteristic ability; and although we will not undertake to say
that the defence contains no single passage that might not as well
have been omitted, we are not aware that, from the beginning to
the end, it is charged with a single paragraph that does not fall
fairly within the limits that the most stringent would prescribe to
scientific controversy.</p>

<p>The discussion of abstract principles is generally unprofitable.
We think few things more clear than that we know not the intrinsic
nature of <i>any</i> abstract principle; and although it would
be presumptuous to say we never shall, yet we think it impossible
for any reflecting student in any science to avoid perceiving that
there are peculiar relations between the <i>laws</i> of nature and the
human capacity, which most emphatically suggest that the study
of the one is the <i>proper business</i>, and the <i>prescribed limit</i> to the
power, of the other.</p>

<p>Still, the poverty of language is such, as regards the expression
of natural phenomena, that necessity has obliged us to clothe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
the forces in nature with some attribute sufficiently in conformity
with our ideas to enable us to give them an intelligible expression;
and, whether we talk of luminous particles, ethereal undulations,
electric or magnetic fluids, matter of heat, &amp;c. we apprehend that
no one now means more than to convey an intellectually tangible
expression, of certain <i>forces</i> in nature, of which he desires to discourse;
in order to describe the <i>habitudes</i> they observe, or the
laws which they obey. This is all we think it necessary to say on
the scientific conduct of the argument by Abernethy.</p>

<p>The public have long since expressed their opinion on Mr.
Lawrence's Reply and Lectures; and whatever may be regarded
as their decision, we have no disposition to canvass or disturb it.
There was nothing wonderful, however unusual, in a young man
so placed, in a profession like ours, getting into a controversy
with a man of such eminence as Abernethy, particularly on speculative
subjects. There were in the present case, to be sure, very
many objections to such a position; but these it was Mr. Lawrence's
province to consider. On this, and many other points, we
have as little inclination as we have right, perhaps, to state our
opinion. Nevertheless, we must not omit a few words in recognition
of Mr. Abernethy's efforts, and a few observations on the
conduct of the governing body of the College at that time. In the
first place, we feel obliged to Mr. Abernethy for the defence he
made on that occasion: not from the importance of any abstract
theory, but from the tendency that his whole tone had to inculcate
just views of the nature and character of the profession. But
we can by no means acquit the Council of the College, at the
time of the said controversy, of what we must conceive to have
been a great neglect of duty. There is, amongst a certain class
of persons, an idea that the medical profession are sceptical on
religious subjects; and many of these persons are people of
whom it is impossible not to value the respect and good opinion.
We never could trace any <i>legitimate</i> grounds for the conclusion.
On inquiry, it has always appeared to be nothing more than a
"vulgar error," resting, as "vulgar errors" generally do, on
general conclusions drawn by people who have deduced them from
insufficient particulars.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes, the persons indulging in this idea have known a
medical man whom <i>they consider</i> to be unstable in his religious
views; another knows that Mr. A. or B. never goes to church;
sometimes, even political differences have been held sufficient
excuse for impugning the soundness of a man's ideas on the all-important
subject of religion. We have never been able to discover
any grounds on which they could, with any show of justice,
support so serious an imputation. For our parts, we know not
how the necessary data are to be obtained, and therefore should
shrink from anything so presumptuous as an attempt to describe
the religious character of any profession.</p>

<p>We have no means of obtaining the evidence necessary even
to examine, much less to support, so serious and difficult a generalization.
The great bulk of our profession are general practitioners;
and in forming opinions in regard to any class of men,
we naturally look to the greatest number. So far as our own
experience has gone, we cannot find the slightest ground for the
degrading imputation. Like all other medical men, their labours
are incessant, their hours of recreation few, and far between. In
their requisitions on their time, the public regard neither night
nor day, nor the Sabbath, when they require attention. Then, if
we look to conduct as no unreasonable test of religion, we may,
like all other professions, have blots. We have, in all grades,
it may be, our fee-hunters and long-billed practitioners; but
whether we regard the physician, surgeon, or general practitioner,
we verily believe that there are no men in the kingdom
who, as a body, conduct themselves more honourably, none who
are less mercenary, none who, in relation to their position, are less
affluent&mdash;no bad test&mdash;nor who do one-tenth of the work which
they do, without any remuneration whatever.</p>

<p>With regard to the alleged absence from public worship, there
may be (however explicable) some ground for the remark, and
especially as no profession shows, in the general respectability of
their conduct, a more ready and respectful acquiescence in the
established usages of mankind.</p>

<p>But let the question be fairly stated. How many medical men
can go to church every Sunday, and to the same church, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
a compromise of a paramount duty? We are ready to concede,
that the necessities which professional calls impose on so many
occasions, may have a tendency to form habits, when impediments
are less pressing; but is it not rather the exactions of the public,
than the choice of the profession, which imposes the necessity?
How many of the public would be satisfied, if they wished to see
a professional man on any pressing occasion, and were told that
he could not be seen for a couple of hours, as he was going to
church?</p>

<p>Highly as we venerate the benign and beautiful ordinance of
the Sabbath, important as we think it, that, on all accounts, it
should be observed with reverence and gratitude,&mdash;still we should
hesitate before we regarded the single act of attendance or absence
on public worship as a safe or charitable exposition of any man's
religious stability. We, therefore, as far as in us lies, repudiate
the charge; we regard it as groundless; and think that, as no
profession affords more frequent opportunities for a constant awakening
and keeping alive the best sympathies of our nature, so no
profession can be more calculated to impress the fragile nature of
the body, as contrasted with the immortal spirit which inhabits it,
or the constant presence of that Power by whose laws they are both
governed. But groundless as we think the charge, we must contend
that the apathy of the Council of the College, at the time
Mr. Lawrence delivered the lectures in question, was a serious
neglect of duty. In those Lectures, Mr. Lawrence spoke of the
Old Testament in a tone which must, we think, be regarded as
irrelevant to, or at least unnecessary in, a course of Lectures on
Comparative Anatomy.</p>

<p>We hold no sympathy with that sort of persecution with
which several well-intentioned people visited the book; but we
must always regard the Council of the time as having been
neglectful of their duty. Lectures on Comparative Anatomy do
not render it necessary to impugn the historical correctness, or
the inspired character, of the Old Testament. What answer
could private individuals make, or with what influence could they
oppose the prejudices of the public in relation to the religious
securities afforded by men in whom they confide, when they saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
a young professor allowed to introduce into lectures&mdash;given to an
audience composed of the most aged and eminent of the profession,
as well as of many of those who were just commencing
their studies, delivered, too, at the chartered College of the profession&mdash;matter
which was not only not at all necessary to the
most ample exposition of the subject, but which, as we have said,
only alluded to the Old Testament in a manner calculated to
weaken its authority as an historical document, and to impugn its
inspired character?</p>

<p>Surely there was no more certain mode of giving an <i>ex
cathedrâ</i> sanction to the unfavourable impressions of the public;
impressions which tend to tarnish the lustre of a profession which
founds its claim to respect on its high office in kindly ministrations
and unquestioned utility; and to arm a vulgar and unfounded prejudice
with all the influence of Collegiate recognition. If, indeed,
the College had desired to support the alleged favourable tendency
of Mr. Abernethy's views, or the alleged opposite bearings of those
to which he was opposed, they could hardly have done better
than to have allowed of the irrelevant matter in question. But
we have done. It is no part of our business to quote passages,
or further to renew discussions long since passed away, than is
necessary for our proper objects. But when we consider on how
many points Abernethy must have been hurt, the very difficult
and perplexing position in which he was placed, we cannot too
much admire the very measured tone he adopted throughout;
or the evidently wounded feeling, but still dignified yet simple
statement in the published Postscript in his Lectures; and though
there had been no subsequent exemplification of his forgiving
temper&mdash;which was not the case&mdash;we should still have felt obliged
to regard the whole affair as indicative of great goodness of heart;
and, when all the circumstances of disappointment and vexation
are duly weighed, of almost unexampled moderation.</p>

<p>It is just to Mr. Lawrence to observe, that, some few years
after this, the Governors of Bethlem Hospital, on the annual (and
usually formal) election of the surgeon, an office held by Mr.
Lawrence, threw the appointment open to competition; on which
occasion Mr. Lawrence published a letter expressing regret, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
general terms, as to certain passages in the Lectures in question,
and his determination not to publish any more on similar subjects.
The coincidence of this letter with the threatened tenure of office,
of course gave rise to the usual remarks; but, if a man say he is
sorry for a thing, perhaps it is better not to scan motives too
closely. Mankind stand too much in need of what Burns suggests,
and with which we close this not very agreeable subject:</p>

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">PREFATORY REMARKS.</p>

<p>In endeavouring to give some idea of Abernethy's manner in
more sustained compositions, we have made some selections from
the Lectures he delivered at the College of Surgeons. Without
any pretensions to a critically faultless style, there always seemed
to us to be a peculiar simplicity, combined with a broad and comprehensive
range of thought. Sometimes, too, he has almost a
"curiosa felicitas" in the tone of his expressions; though this
was more remarkable, we think, when he felt more free; that is,
in his unrivalled teaching at the Hospital, of which we shall endeavour
to give a more particular account. As we have before
remarked, it is impossible to do full justice to Abernethy, unless
we were to publish his works, with a running commentary; and
we fear that in the selections we offer we have incurred a responsibility
which we shall not properly fulfil. To convey the full,
the suggestive merit of even some of the following passages, it
would be necessary to state carefully the relation they bear to the
state of science, both chemical and physiological, at the time they
were written, and the present.</p>

<p>The interest of the Lectures is so evenly distributed through
the whole, that selection is very difficult; and being obliged to
consider our limits, we have, in the absence of a better guide,
selected the passages at random, as suggested by our own impressions
of them. We therefore can only earnestly recommend
the perusal of the Lectures themselves, as equally entertaining
and instructive to the general as well as the professional reader.
The varied expression and manner, and his fine intellectual countenance,
by which he imparted so much interest to his delivery
on every subject he touched, will be considered in connection
with his success in the art of lecturing, to which these somewhat
formal specimens may serve as an introduction.</p>

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">THE APPARENT UNIVERSAL DISTRIBUTION OF SOME POWERFUL<br />
FORCE LIKE ELECTRICITY, MAGNETISM, ETC.</p>

<p>"When, therefore, we perceive in the universe at large a
cause of rapid and powerful motions of masses of inert matter,
may we not naturally conclude that the inert molecules of vegetable
and animal matter may be made to move in a similar
manner by a similar cause?"</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">REPUDIATION OF AN OFTEN-ALLEGED OPINION.</p>

<p>"It is not meant that electricity is life. There are strong
analogies between electricity and magnetism; and yet I do not
know that any one has been hardy enough to assert their absolute
identity<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor"><sup>40</sup></a>. I only mean to prove that Mr. Hunter's theory
is verifiable, by showing that a subtile substance of a quickly,
powerfully mobile nature seems to pervade everything, and appears
to be the life of the world; and therefore it is probable
that a similar substance pervades organized bodies, and produces
similar effects in them.</p>

<p>"The opinions which, in former times, were a justifiable hypothesis,
seem to me now to be converted into a rational
theory<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor"><sup>41</sup></a>."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">IN RELATION TO MICROSCOPIC OBSERVATION.</p>

<p>"This general and imperfect sketch of the anatomy of the
nervous system relates only to what may be discovered by
our unassisted sight. If by means of the microscope we endeavour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
to observe the ultimate nervous fibres, persons in general
are as much at a loss as when, by the same means, they
attempt to trace the ultimate muscular fibres<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor"><sup>42</sup></a>."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">ILLUSTRATION, OF MOTION NOT NECESSARILY IMPLYING SENSATION.</p>

<p>"Assuredly, motion does not necessarily imply sensation; it
takes place where no one ever yet imagined there could be sensation.
If I put on the table a basin containing a saturated solution
of salt, and threw into it a single crystal, the act of crystallization
would begin from the point touched, and rapidly and regularly
pervade the liquor till it assumed a solid form. Yet I know I
should incur your ridicule if I suggested the idea that the stimulus
of salt had primarily excited the action, or that its extension
was the effect of continuous sympathy. If, also, I
threw a spark amongst gunpowder; what would you think, were
I to represent the explosion as a struggle resentful of injury, or
the noise as the clamorous expression of pain<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor"><sup>43</sup></a>?"</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">IMPORTANCE OF OPINIONS.</p>

<p>"Thinking being inevitable, we ought, as I said, to be solicitous
to think correctly. Opinions are equally the natural result
of thought, and the cause of conduct. If errors of thought
terminated in opinions, they would be of less consequence; but
a slight deviation from the line of rectitude in thought may
lead to a most distant and disastrous aberration from that line
in action. I own I cannot readily believe any one who tells
me he has formed no opinion on subjects which must have engaged
and interested his attention. Persons both of sceptical
and credulous characters form opinions, and we have in general
some principal opinion, to which we connect the rest, and to
which we make them subservient; and this has a great influence
on all our conduct. Doubt and uncertainty are so fatiguing
to the human mind, by keeping it in continual action, that it
will and must rest somewhere; and if so, our inquiry ought to
be where it may rest most securely and comfortably to itself,
and with most advantage to others.</p>

<p>"In the uncertainty of opinions, wisdom would counsel us
to adopt those which have a tendency to produce beneficial
actions."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">INDEPENDENCE OF MIND ON LIFE AS ARISING OUT OF THE IDEA<br />
THAT LIFE WAS SUPERADDED TO ORGANIZATION&mdash;HIS DISPOSITION<br />
TO ALLEGORY.</p>

<p>"If I may be allowed to express myself allegorically with
regard to our intellectual operations, I would say that the mind
chooses for itself some little spot or district, where it erects a
dwelling, which it furnishes and decorates with the various materials
it collects. Of many apartments contained in it, there
is one to which it is most partial, where it chiefly reposes, and
where it sometimes indulges its visionary fancies. At the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
time, it employs itself in cultivating the surrounding grounds,
raising little articles for intellectual traffic with its neighbours,
or perhaps some produce worthy to be deposited amongst the
general stores of human knowledge. Thus my mind rests at
peace in thinking on the subject of life, as it has been taught
by Mr. Hunter; and I am visionary enough to imagine that if
these opinions should become so established as to be generally
admitted by philosophers, that if they once saw reason to believe
that life was something of an invisible and active nature
<i>superadded</i> to organization, they would then see equal reason
to believe that mind might be superadded to life, as life is to
structure. They would then, indeed, still further perceive how
mind and matter might reciprocally operate on each other by
means of an intervening substance. Thus, even, would physiological
researches enforce the belief which I say is natural to
man: that, in addition to his bodily frame, he possesses a sensitive,
intelligent, and <i>independent</i> mind&mdash;an opinion which
tends in an eminent degree to produce virtuous, honourable,
and useful actions<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor"><sup>45</sup></a>."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">ATTRACTIONS OF PhYSIOLOGY&mdash;THE NECESSITY OF EXAMINING<br />
BOTH HEALTH AND DISEASE A VERY IMPORTANT POINT JUST<br />
NOW, AS TESTING THE VALIDITY OF CERTAIN VIEWS OF LIEBIG<br />
AND OTHERS.</p>

<p>"No study can surely be so interesting as Physiology. Whilst
other sciences carry us abroad in search of objects, in this we
are engaged at home, and on concerns highly important to us,
in inquiring into the means by which 'we live, and move, and
have our being.' To those, however, engaged in the practice
of Medicine, the study of Physiology is indispensable; for it is
evident that the nature of the disordered actions of parts or
organs can never be understood or judiciously counteracted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
unless the nature of their healthy actions be previously
known.</p>

<p>"The study of Physiology, however, not only requires that
we should investigate the nature of the various vital processes
carried on in our own bodies, but also that we should compare
them with similar processes in all the varieties of living beings;
not only that we should consider them in a state of natural and
healthy action, but also under all the varying circumstances of
disorder and disease. Few indeed have studied Physiology
thus extensively, and none in an equal degree with Mr. Hunter.
Whoever attentively peruses his writings, must, I think, perceive
that he draws his crowds of facts from such different and
remote sources, as to make it extremely difficult to assemble
and arrange them<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor"><sup>46</sup></a>."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">OF DISORDER AND DISEASE.</p>

<p>"Disorder, which is the effect of faulty actions of <i>nerves</i>, induces
disease, which is the consequence of faulty actions of the
<i>vessels</i>. There are some who find it difficult to understand
how similar swellings or ulcers may form in various parts of
the body in consequence of general nervous disorder, and are
all curable by appeasing and removing such general disorder.
The fact is indisputable. Such persons are not so much surprised
that general nervous disorder should produce local effects
in the nervous and muscular systems; yet they cannot so well
understand how it should locally affect the vascular system. To
me there appears nothing wonderful in such events; for the
local affection is primarily nervous, and the vascular actions are
consequent. Yet it must indeed be granted that there may be
other circumstances leading to the peculiarities of local diseases,
with which, at present, we are unacquainted. Disorder excites
to disease, and when <i>important organs</i> become in a degree diseased,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
they will still perform their functions moderately well,
<i>if disorder</i> be relieved, which <i>ought to be the Alpha and Omega
of medical attention</i><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor"><sup>47</sup></a>."</p>

<p>As we have seen, in the early part of our narrative, he was
one of the first to insist on the importance of Comparative Anatomy
and Physiology, and, as we shall have to relate, most active
in securing what has proved so greatly influential to its progress
in this country (the appointment of Professor Owen). Yet he
modestly ignores any positive pretensions which might be imputed
to him from his endeavour to illustrate a Museum dealing so
largely with Comparative Anatomy.</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>"Gratitude to the former of the Museum, and also to the
donors to it, equally demand that its value and excellency
should be publicly acknowledged and displayed, which consideration
has goaded me on to undertake and imperfectly execute a
task for which I feel myself not properly qualified."</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>Here follows what is very candid in Abernethy, and honourable
to Mr. Clift, who had very many debtors who were less communicative.</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>"I cordially acknowledge that I have little acquaintance with
the subject, except what I derived from looking over the preparations
in the Museum, from reading Professor Cuvier's Lectures,
and from the frank and friendly communications of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
highly praiseworthy conservator, Mr. Clift. Permit me to say,
gentlemen, though many know it already, that Mr. Clift resided
with Mr. Hunter, and was taught by him to exhibit anatomical
facts in preparations,&mdash;that he does credit to his excellent instructor,&mdash;that
he feels the same interest and zeal that his
patron did for the improvement of this department of science,&mdash;and
that he possesses the same candour and simplicity of character<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor"><sup>48</sup></a>."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">OF DEEP AND SUPERFICIAL THINKING.</p>

<p>"I now beg leave to add that there are many who think
clearly, who do not think deeply; and they have greatly the
advantage in expressing themselves, for their thoughts are generally
simple and easy of apprehension. Opinions immediately
deduced from any series or assemblage of facts may be called
primary opinions, and they become types and representatives
of the facts from which they are formed, and, like the facts
themselves, admit of assortment, comparison, and inference; so
that from them we deduce ulterior opinions, till at length, by
a kind of intellectual calculation, we obtain some general total,
which in like manner becomes the representative and co-efficient
of all our knowledge, with relation to the subject examined and
considered.</p>

<p>"In proportion to the pains we have taken in this algebraical
process of the mind, and our assurance of its correctness, so do
we contemplate the conclusion or consummation of our labours
with satisfaction<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor"><sup>49</sup></a>."</p>

literary property, the hard-earned gainings of great
talent and unparalleled industry. It is not, however, for the
property that I plead; because already that is secured; it is

<p>"Believing that no man will labour in the strenuous and unremitting
manner that Mr. Hunter did, and to the detriment of
his own private interest, without some strong incentive; I have
supposed that at an early period he conceived those notions of
life which were confirmed by his future inquiries and experiments.
He began his observations on the incubated egg, in
the year 1755, which must either have suggested or corroborated
all his opinions with regard to the cause of the vital phenomena.
He perceived that, however different in form and
faculty, every creature was nevertheless allied to himself, because
it was a living being; and therefore he became solicitous to
inquire how the vital processes were carried on in all the varieties

<p>"In the progress of science, genius with light and airy steps
often far precedes judgment, which proceeds slowly, and either
finds or forms a road along which all may proceed with facility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>

often suggested, and its actions are excited and accelerated, by

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">REITERATION OF THE DENIAL THAT HE IDENTIFIED LIFE WITH<br />
ELECTRICITY.</p>

<p>"As Sir H. Davy's experiments fully prove that electricity
may be superadded to, and that it enters into, the composition
of all those substances we call matter, I felt satisfied with the
establishment of the philosophy of Mr. Hunter's views, nor
thought it necessary to proceed further, but merely added: 'It
is not meant to be affirmed that electricity is life.' I only
mean to argue in favour of Mr. Hunter's theory, by showing
that a subtile substance of a quickly and powerfully mobile
nature seems to pervade everything, and appears to be the life
of the world; and that therefore it is probable a similar substance
pervades organized bodies, and is the life of these bodies.
I am concerned, yet obliged, to detain you by this recapitulation,
because my meaning has been either misunderstood or
misrepresented<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor"><sup>52</sup></a>."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">CHEMISTRY OF LIFE.</p>

<p>"He (Mr. Hunter) told us that life was a great chemist,
and, even in a seemingly quiescent state, had the power of resisting
the operations of external chemical agency, and thereby
preventing the decomposition of those bodies in which it resided.
Thus seeds may lie buried far beneath the surface of
the earth for a great length of time without decaying, but being
thrown up, they vegetate. Mr. Hunter showed us that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
chemist, 'Life,' had the power of regulating the temperature of
the substances in which it resides<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor"><sup>53</sup></a>."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">INTERESTING; ALSO SIGNIFICANT IN REGARD TO WHAT ARE PROBABLY<br />
THE REAL SOURCES OF ANIMAL HEAT, AND IN RELATION<br />
TO THE LUNGS, WHICH WE HAVE CONTENDED ARE REFRIGERATING<br />
AND NOT HEATING ORGANS.</p>

<p>"The progress of science since Mr. Hunter's time has
wonderfully manifested that the beam, when dissected by a
prism, is not only separable into seven calorific rays of different
refrangibility, producing the iridescent spectrum, but also into
calorific rays refracted in the greatest degree or intensity beyond
the red colour, and into rays not calorific, refracted in like
manner, to the opposite side of the spectrum beyond the violet
colour; and that the calorific and uncalorific rays produce
effects similar to those occasioned by the two kinds of electricity;
and thus afforded additional reasons for believing that subtile,
mobile substances do enter into the composition of all those
bodies which the sun illumines, or its beams can penetrate.</p>

<p>"Late observations induce the belief that even light may be
incorporated in a latent state with animal substances and afterwards
elicited by a kind of spontaneous separation by vital
actions, or by causes that seem to act mechanically on the substance
in which it inheres. All the late discoveries in science
seem to realize the speculations of ancient philosophers, and
show that all the changes and motions which occur in surrounding
bodies, as well as those in which we live, are the effect of
subtile and invisible principles existing in them, or acting on
them. Mr. Ellis, who, with such great industry and intelligence,
has collated all the scattered evidences relative to the
production of heat in living bodies, and added so much to the
collected knowledge, seems to think that all the variations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
temperature in them may be accounted for by known chemical
processes.</p>

<p>"Here, however, I must observe, that Mr. Hunter's opinion
of life having the power of regulating temperature was deduced,
not only from his own experiments, related in the 'Philosophical
Transactions,' but also from observing, that, in certain
<i>affections of the stomach, the heat of the body is subject to great
vicissitudes, whilst respiration and circulation remain unaltered</i>;
and also that parts of the body are subject to similar variations,
which appear inexplicable upon any other supposition than that
of <i>local nervous excitement</i>, or torpor, or some similar affections
of the vital powers of the part which undergoes such
transitions<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor"><sup>54</sup></a>."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">ALLEGED TENDENCIES OF A BELIEF IN THE INDEPENDENT<br />
NATURE OF MIND.</p>

<p>"It is equally apparent that the belief of the distinct and
independent nature of mind incites us to act rightly from principle;
to relieve distress, to repel aggression, and defend those
who are incapable of protecting themselves; to practise and
extol whatever is virtuous, excellent, and honourable; to shun
and condemn whatever is vicious and base, regardless also of
our own personal feelings and interests when put in competition
with our duty<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor"><sup>55</sup></a>."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">OF PHRENOLOGY.</p>

<p>"There is nothing in the assertions of Drs. Gall and Spurzheim
contradictory to the results of general observation and
experience. It is admitted that the superior intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
faculties can and ought to control the inferior propensities.
It is admitted that we possess organs, which, nevertheless, may
be inactive from general torpor or want of education. General
observation and experience proclaim that susceptibility is the
chief incentive to action, that it is the source of genius; and
that the character of the man greatly depends on his education
and habits. We educate our faculties; what is at first accomplished
with difficulty, by repetition is easily performed, and
becomes more perfect and established by habit. Trains of perceptions
and thoughts also become firmly concentrated, and
occur in succession. Even our feelings undergo the same kind
of education and establishment. Casual feelings of goodwill
by repetition strengthen and produce lasting friendships; whilst
trivial sensations of disgust, in like manner, may occasion inveterate
hatred."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">ON THE SAME.</p>

<p>"Should the result of our general inquiries, or attention to
the subjects proposed to us by Drs. Gall and Spurzheim, induce
us to believe that the peculiarities of our feelings and faculties
were the effects of variety of excitement, transmitted through
a diversity of organization, they would tend to produce mutual
forbearance and toleration. We should perceive how nearly
impossible it must be that any persons should think and feel
exactly alike upon any subject. We should not arrogantly
pride ourselves on our own virtue and knowledge, nor condemn
the errors and weakness of others, since they may depend upon
causes which we can neither produce nor readily counteract.
The path of virtue is plain and direct, and its object distinctly
before us; so that no one can miss either, who has resolution
enough never to lose sight of them, by adverting to advantages
and allurements with which he may be presented on the one hand,
or the menacings with which he may be assailed on the other.
Yet no one, judging from his own feelings and powers, can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
aware of the kind and degree of temptation or terror, or the
seeming incapacity to resist them, which may have induced
others to deviate. Now, though from the foregoing considerations
I am pleased with the speculations of Drs. Gall and
Spurzheim, I am quite incompetent to give any opinion as to
the probability of what they have suggested; because I see no
mode by which we can with propriety admit or reject their
assertions, except by pursuing the same course of investigations
which they themselves have followed; a task of great labour
and difficulty, and one which, for various reasons, I should feel
great repugnance to undertake<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor"><sup>56</sup></a>."</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>Abernethy used to like very well to talk with Spurzheim, who
resided for some time in this country. One day, Abernethy, half-seriously,
half-humorously said to Spurzheim: "Well, Doctor,
where do you place the organ of common sense?" Spurzheim's
reply certainly sustained the coincidence of phrenological deductions
with those of experience. "There is no organ," said
he, "for common sense, but it depends on the equilibrium of the
other organs."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">THEOLOGICAL APPLICATION OF ANATOMICAL FACTS.</p>

<p>"Therefore, from this least interesting part of anatomy, we
derive the strongest conviction of there being design and contrivance
in the construction of animals. Equal evidences of
design and contrivance and of adaptation of means to ends may
be observed in the construction of the framework, as I may
call it, of other animals, as in that of man, which subject seems
to me very happily displayed in Professor Cuvier's Lectures<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor"><sup>57</sup></a>.</p>

<p>"It was, however, the comparing the mechanism of the hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
and foot that led Galen, who they say was a sceptic in his
youth, to the public declaration of his opinion that intelligence
must have operated in ordaining the laws by which living
beings are constructed. That Galen was a man of a very
superior intellect could readily be proved, were it necessary. I
have often known the passage I allude to made a subject of
reference, but not of quotation, and therefore I recite it on the
present occasion, and particularly because it shows that Galen
was not in the least degree tinctured with superstition. 'In
explaining these things,' he says, 'I esteem myself as composing
a solemn hymn to the great Architect of our bodily
frame, in which I think there is more true piety than in
sacrificing whole hecatombs of oxen, or in burning the most
costly perfumes; for, first, I endeavour from His works to know
Him myself, and afterwards by the same means to show Him
to others, to inform them how great is His wisdom, goodness,
and power<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor"><sup>58</sup></a>.'"</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER OF LIVING BODIES.</p>

<p>"Those bodies which we call living are chiefly characterized
by their powers of converting surrounding substances into their
own nature, of building up the structure of their own bodies,
and repairing the injuries they may accidentally sustain<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor"><sup>59</sup></a>."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">IN REPUDIATION OF CRUELTY AND EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMALS.</p>

<p>Very important in our view. The objection was very new
at that time, and has made very little way yet. We have
already referred to this subject. Considering the period of
these Lectures (nearly forty years ago), Abernethy's objections,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
though cautious, are very sound, and, for him, very positive. We
know that he felt still more strongly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hunter, whom I should not have believed to be very
scrupulous about inflicting sufferings upon animals, nevertheless
censures Spalanzani for the unmeaning repetition of similar
experiments. Having resolved publicly to express my own
opinion with respect to this subject, I choose the present opportunity
to do it, because I believe Spalanzani to have been one
of those who have tortured and destroyed animals in vain. I
do not perceive that in the two principal subjects which he
sought to elucidate, he has added any important fact to our
stock of knowledge; besides, some of his experiments are of a
nature that a good man would have blushed to think of, and a
wise man ashamed to publish, for they prove no fact requiring
to be proved, and only show that the aforesaid Abbé was a
filthy-minded fellow."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">ON THE SAME.</p>

<p>"The design of experiments is to interrogate nature; and
surely the inquirer ought to make himself acquainted with the
language of nature, and take care to propose pertinent questions.
He ought further to consider the probable kind of replies that
may be made to his inquiries, and the inferences that may be
warranted in drawing from different responses, so as to be able
to determine whether, by the commission of cruelty, he is likely
to obtain adequate instruction. Indeed, before we make experiments
on sensitive beings, we ought further to consider
whether the information we seek may not be attainable by other
means. I am aware of the advantages which have been derived
from such experiments when made by persons of talent, and
who have properly prepared themselves; but I know that these
experiments tend to harden the feelings which often lead to the
inconsiderate performance of them.</p>

<p>"Surely we should endeavour to foster, and not stifle, benevolence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
the best sentiment of our nature, that which is productive
of the greatest gratification both to its possessor and
to others. <i>Considering the professors in this place as the
organs of the Court of the College</i>, addressing its members, I
feel that I act as becomes a senior of this institution, whilst
admitting the propriety of the practice under the foregoing
restrictions, I, at the same time, express an earnest hope that
the character of an English surgeon may never be tarnished by
the commission of inconsiderate or unnecessary cruelty<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor"><sup>60</sup></a>."</p>

<p>"To me, however, who confide more in the eye of reason

of the structure described, because we can discern no other.

with how little and with what various organization life could
accomplish its principal functions of assimilation, formation, and
multiplication. Who has seen the multitudinous distribution
of absorbing vessels, and all the other organization, which
doubtless exists in the vitreous humour of the eye, than which

THUS, WE MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED MUCH UNSOUND THEORIZING<br />
ON THIS IMPORTANT PROCESS.</p>

<p>"Chemists have considered the change as contributory to the
production of animal heat, which opinion may, indeed, be true,
though the manner in which it produces such an effect has
not, as yet, been explained. Mr. Hunter, who believed that
life had the power of regulating temperature, <i>independently of</i>
respiration, says nothing of that process as directly contributing
to such an effect. He says: 'Breathing seems to render life
to the blood, and the blood conveys it to every part of the
body,' yet he believes the blood derives its vitality also from
the food. I am at a loss to know what chemists now think
respecting heat, whether they consider it to be a distinct species
of matter, or mere motion and vibration. Among the curious
revolutions which this age has produced, those of chemical
opinions have a fair claim to distinction. To show which, I
may add, that a lady<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor"><sup>64</sup></a>, on her first marriage, was wedded to
that scientific champion who first overthrew phlogiston, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
established, in its stead, the empire of caloric; and after his
decease, on her second nuptials, was united to the man who
vainly supposed he had subverted the rule of caloric and restored
the ancient but long-banished dynasty of motion and
vibration. In this state of perplexity, I cannot, with prudence
or probable security, advance one step further than Mr. Hunter
has led me. I must believe respiration to be essential to life,
and that life has the power, by its actions, of maintaining and
regulating temperature<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor"><sup>65</sup></a>."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">CHARACTERISTIC, BOTH AS TO ILLUSTRATION AND MORAL<br />
BEARING.</p>

<p>"Those of the medical profession must readily accord with
the remark of Shakspeare, that such affections (disturbed states
of the nervous system) which may well indeed be called
'master passions,' sway us to their mood in what we like or
loathe. For we well know that our patients and ourselves,
from disturbance of the nervous functions of the digestive
organs, producing such affections of the brain, may become
irritable, petulant, and violent about trifles, or oppressed, morose,
and desponding. Permit me, however, to add that those of the
medical profession must be equally apprized that when the
functions of the mind are not disturbed by such affections, it
displays great energy of thought, and evidence of established
character, even in death. Have we not lately heard that the
last words of Nelson were: 'Tell Collingwood to bring the
fleet to an anchor?' Shakspeare has also represented Mercutio
continuing to jest, though he was mortally wounded; the expiring
Hotspur thinking of nothing but honour, and the dying Falstaff
cracking his jokes on Bardolph's nose. I request you to excuse
this digression, which I have been induced to make, from perceiving
that, if such facts were duly attended to, they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
prompt us to a more liberal allowance for each other's conduct,
under certain circumstances, than we are accustomed to do;
and also incite us to the more active and constant performance
of the great business of human life&mdash;the education of the mind;
for, according to its knowledge and dispositions, do we possess
the ability of contributing to our own welfare and comfort, and
that of others<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor"><sup>66</sup></a>."</p>

<p>Lecturing after a fashion is easy enough; <i>teaching</i> is a very
different affair. The one requires little more than good information,
some confidence, and a <i>copia verborum</i>; the other establishes
several additional requisitions. These requisitions, when
rendered comparatively easy by nature, are seldom perfectly matured
without art and careful study. The transmission of ideas
from one mind to another, in a simple, unequivocal form, is not
always easy; but, in teaching, the object is not merely to convey
the idea, but to give a lively and lasting impression&mdash;something
that should not merely cause the retention of the image, but in
such connection as to excite another process, "thought."</p>

<p>There was no peculiarity in Abernethy more striking than
the power he possessed of communicating his ideas, and of sustaining
the interest of the subject on which he spoke. For this
there is no doubt he was greatly indebted to natural talent; but
it is equally clear that he had cultivated it with much care. His
ability as a lecturer was, we think, unique. We never saw his
like before: we hardly dare hope we shall again.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that a great part of his success depended
on a facility of giving that variety of expression, and that versatility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
of manner, which falls within the province of what we must
call dramatic; but then it was of the very highest description, in
that it was perfectly natural. It was of that kind which we sometimes
find in an actor, and which conveys the impression that he
is speaking his own sentiments, rather than those of the author.
It is a species of talent which dies with its possessor, and cannot,
we think, be conveyed by description. Still there were many things
in Abernethy that were observable, and such as could hardly have
been acquired without study.</p>

<p>If we examine any lecturer's style, and ask ourselves what is
his fault, we shall find very few in whom we cannot detect one or
more. When we do this, and then reflect on Abernethy, we are
astonished to find how many he avoided. We shall endeavour to
make this as intelligible as we can, by citing some of the points
which our attention to different lecturers have suggested.</p>

<p>"Simplicity" has struck us as a feature which, in some sense
or other, is very commonly defective. Simplicity appears so important,
that perhaps, by not a very illegitimate extension of its
meaning, it might be made to include almost all the requisitions
of this mode of teaching. Let us think of it in relation to language
and illustration. In all sciences, the <i>facts</i> are simple; the
laws are yet <i>more so</i>; increasing knowledge tends to impress on
us an ever-increasing and comprehensive simplicity. In explaining
simple things, no doubt language should be simple too. If
we employ language unnecessarily technical, we use symbols to
which the learner is unaccustomed. He has not to learn the facts
<i>only</i>; but he has the <i>additional labour</i> of something allied to
learning it in a foreign language. The <i>unnecessary</i> use of technicalities
should then surely be avoided. Abernethy was obliged
to use them, because there were often no other terms; but he
always avoided any needless multiplication of them. When they
were difficult or objectionable, he tried some manœuvre to lighten
the repulsiveness of them.</p>

<p>There are many muscles in the neck with long names, and
which are generally given with important parts of surgical anatomy.
Here he used to chat a little; he called them the <i>little</i>
muscles with the <i>long</i> names; but he would add, that, after all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
they were the best-named muscles in the body, because their
names expressed their attachments. This gave him an excuse for
referring to what he had just described, in the form of a narrative,
rather than a dry repetition. Then, with regard to one
muscle, that he wished particularly to impress, the name of which
was longer than any of the others, he used to point it out as a
striking feature in all statues; and then, repeating its attachments,
and pointing to the sites which they occupied, say it was
impossible to do so without having the image of the muscle
before us.</p>

<p>In other parts of the Lectures, he would accompany the technical
name by the popular one. Thus he would speak of the
pancreas, or sweetbread; cartilage, or gristle. Few people are
aware how many difficulties are smoothed by such simple manœuvres.
Nothing interests people so much as giving anything
<i>positive</i>. We think it not improbable that many a man has heard
a lecture, in which animals have been described with whose habits
he had been perfectly familiar, without having recognized his
familiar acquaintances in the disguise afforded by a voluminous
Greek compound. Abernethy seemed always to lecture, not so
much as if he was telling us what he <i>knew</i>, as that which <i>we</i> did
<i>not</i> know. There was an absence of all display of any kind
whatever.</p>

<p>To hear some lecturers, one would almost think that they
adopted the definition of language which is reported of Talleyrand&mdash;that
it was intended to conceal our ideas. Some make
simple things very much otherwise by the mode of explaining
them. This reminds us of a very worthy country clergyman, in
the west of England, who, happening to illustrate something in
his sermon by reference to the qualities of pitch, thought he
should help his rustic congregation by enlarging a little on the
qualities of that mineral. He accordingly commenced by saying,
"Now, dear brethren, pitch is a bituminous substance:" rather
a difficult beginning, we should think, to have brought to a successful
conclusion.</p>

<p>Sometimes we have heard a very unnecessary catalogue of
technicalities joined with several propositions in one sentence. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
is hardly to be imagined how this increases the difficulty to a
beginner; whilst it impresses the excellence of that simplicity and
clearness which were so charming in Abernethy. We give an
example of this defect. The lecturer is describing the continuation
of the cuticle over the eyes of the crustacea, as lobsters, &amp;c.:
"The epidermis (the cuticle) in the compound eyes of the crustacea
passes transparent and homogeneous over the external
surface of the thick layer of the prismatic corneæ, which are
here, as in insects, generally hexagonal, but sometimes quadrangular;
and to the internal ends of the prismatic corneæ are
applied the broad bases of the hard, tapering, transparent lenses,
which have their internal truncated apices directed to the retinal
expansions of the numerous optic nerves."</p>

<p>The high respect we entertain for the lecturer here alluded to,
withholds us from attempting to supply a more homely version
of the foregoing passage. But what an idea this must give to
a student who reads it in "the outlines" of a science of which he
is about to commence the study. There is nothing whatever difficult
in the ideas themselves; but what a bristling <i>chevaux-de-frise</i>
of hard words, what a phalanx of propositions! We fear
we should never arrive at the knowledge of many of those
beautiful adaptations which all animals exemplify, if we had to
approach them by such a forbidding pathway.</p>

<p>As contrasted with simple facts thus obscured by an unnecessary
complexity of expression, we may see in Abernethy how a
very comprehensive proposition may be very simply expressed.
Take almost the first sentence in his Surgical Lectures, the germ,
as it were, of a new science: "Now I say that local disease, injury,
or irritation, may affect the whole system; and conversely,
that disturbance of the whole system may affect any part."</p>

<p>We have sometimes thought that lecturers who have had
several desirable qualifications have materially diminished the
attraction of them by faults which we hardly know how to designate
by a better term than vulgarity, ill-breeding, or <i>gaucherie</i>.
Now Abernethy had, in the first place, that most difficult thing
to acquire, the appearance of <i>perfect ease, without</i> the slightest
<i>presumption</i>. Some lecturers appear painfully "in company;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
others have a self-complacent assurance, that conveys an unfavourable
impression to most well-bred people. Abernethy had a calm,
quiet sort of ease, with that expression of thought which betokened
respect for his task and his audience, with just enough
of effort only, to show that his mind was in his business.</p>

<p>He had no offensive tricks. We have known lecturers who
never began without making faces; others who intersperse the
lecture with unseemly gesticulations. Some, on the most trivial
occasion, as referring to a diagram, are constantly turning their
backs <i>completely</i> to the audience. This is, we know, disagreeable
to many people, and, unless a lecturer is very clear and articulate,
occasionally renders his words not distinctly audible. Even in
explaining diagrams, it is seldom necessary to turn quite round;
the smallest inclination towards the audience satisfies the requisitions
of good breeding, reminds them agreeably of a respect
with which they never fail to be pleased, and of the lecturer's
self-possession.</p>

<p>There are, indeed, occasions when the lecturer had better turn
a little aside. Not long ago, we heard a very sensible lecturer,
and a very estimable man, produce an effect which was rather
ludicrous&mdash;a very inconvenient impression when not intended.
He had been stating, very clearly, some important facts, and he
then observed: "The great importance of these facts I will now
proceed to explain to you;" when he immediately began to
apply the pocket-handkerchief he had in his hand most elaborately
to his nose, still fronting the audience. It had the most ridiculous
effect, and followed so closely on the preceding remark, as
to suggest to the humorously inclined that it was part of the
proposed explanation.</p>

<p>Some think it excusable to cast their eyes upwards, with an
expression of intense thought, or even to carry their hands to
their heads or forehead for the same purpose. But this conveys
a painful feeling to the audience, whose attention is apt to be diverted
from the subject by sympathy with the apparent embarrassment
of the lecturer. Sometimes it conveys the impression
of affectation, which of course is one form of vulgarity.</p>

<p>Abernethy was remarkably free from anything of the kind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
The expression of his countenance was, in the highest degree,
clear, penetrative, and intellectual; and his long, but not neglected,
powdered hair, which covered both ears, gave altogether a
philosophic calmness to his whole expression that was peculiarly
pleasing. Then came a sort of little smile, which mantled over
the whole face, and lighted it up with something which we cannot
define, but which seemed a compound of mirth, archness, and
benevolence.</p>

<p>The adjustment of the quantity of matter to the time employed
in discussing it, is an important point in teaching. A
lecture too <i>full</i>, is as objectionable as a lecture <i>too long</i>. If the
matter is spread too thinly, the lecture is bald and uninteresting,
and apt to fall short of representing any integral division of a
subject; if it be too thick, it is worse, for then all is confused
and difficult. A man's brain is like a box packed in a hurry;
when all is done, you neither know what you have got, nor what
you have forgotten.</p>

<p>Here again Abernethy was in general very happy. Various
circumstances would sometimes, indeed, in the Anatomical Course,
oblige him to put more into one lecture than was usual; but he
had always, in such a case, some little manœuvre to sustain the
attention of his audience. No man was ever a more perfect
master of the <i>ars est celare artem</i>. Everything he did had its
object, every joke or anecdote its particular errand, which was in
general most effectively fulfilled.</p>

<p>The various ways in which Abernethy managed to lighten up
the general lecture, or to illustrate single points, can hardly be
conveyed by selection of particular examples. There was a sort
of running metaphor in his language, which, aided by a certain
quaintness of manner, made common things go very amusingly.
Muscles which pursued the same course to a certain point, were
said to travel sociably together, and then to "part company."
Blood-vessels and nerves had certain habits in their mode of distribution
contrasted in this way; arteries were said to <i>creep</i> along
the sides or between muscles. Nerves, on the contrary, were
represented as penetrating their substance "<i>without ceremony</i>."
Then he had always a ready sympathy with his audience. If a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
thing was difficult, he would, as we have said, anticipate the feelings
of the student. This is always encouraging; because, when
a student finds a point difficult, if he is merely diffident, he is
depressed; if he is disposed to be lazy, he finds too good an excuse
for it.</p>

<p>Abernethy's illustrations were usually drawn from some source
already familiar; and if they were calculated to impress the fact,
he was not very scrupulous whence he drew them. This would
sometimes lead him into little trippings against refinement; but
these were never wanton. Everything had its object, from the
most pathetic tale down to the smallest joke. When the thing
to be impressed was not so much single facts or propositions, as
a more continued series, he had an admirable mode of pretending
to con over the lecture in a manner which he would first recommend
students to do&mdash;something after this fashion: "Let me
see&mdash;what did he say?" "Well, first he told us that he should
speak of Matter in general; then he said something about the
Laws of Matter, of Inertia, &amp;c. Well, I did not understand
much of that; and I don't think he knew much about it himself;"
and so on. There would now be a general smile; the
attention of the class would be thoroughly alive; and then he
would, in this "conning over," bring forward the points he most
wished to impress of the whole lecture. A very striking proof of
how much power he had in this way, came out in a conversation
I had with Dr. Thomas Rees. This gentleman knew Abernethy
well, and, in kindly answering some inquiries I made of him, he
spoke of his power in lecturing. Amongst other things, he said:
"The first lecture I ever heard him give, impressed me very
much; I thought it admirable. His skill appeared so extraordinary!
At the conclusion of the lecture," said Dr. Rees,
"he proposed to the students to con over the lecture, which he
proceeded to do for them." Dr. Rees then continued repeating
the heads of the lecture, and this after at least thirty,
perhaps forty years.</p>

<p>Lecturers will sometimes endeavour to illustrate a point which
is difficult or obscure by something more difficult still, or something
borrowed from another branch of science. Sometimes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
illustrations are so lengthy, or intrinsically important, that a pupil
forgets <i>what principle</i> it was that was <i>to be illustrated</i>. When
we are desirous of learning something about water or air, it is
painful for a pupil to be "reminded" of the "properties of angles,"
which it is an even chance he never knew. It is equally uncomfortable
to many an audience, in lectures on <i>other subjects</i>, to
have the course of a cannon-ball, which three pieces of string
would sufficiently explain, for mere purposes of illustration, charged
with the "laws of projectiles," the "composition of forces," &amp;c.
We are of course not thinking of learn<i>ed</i> but learn<i>ing</i> audiences.
To the former, lectures are of no use; but we allude to learners
of mixed information and capacity; like young men who have
been residing with medical men in the country; who come to a
lecture for information, and who require to be interested, in order
that they may be instructed. Abernethy's illustrations were
always in simple language. Rough ridden sometimes by a succession
of many-footed Greek compounds, the mind of a student
loves to repose on the refreshing simplicity of household phrases.</p>

<p>Abernethy had stories innumerable. Every case almost was
given with the interest of a tale; and every tale impressed some
lesson, or taught some relation in the structure, functions, or
diseases of the body. We will give one or two; but their effect
lay in the admirable manner in which they were related.</p>

<p>If he was telling anything at all humorous, it would be lighted
up by his half-shut, half-smiling, and habitually benevolent eye.
Yet his eye would easily assume the fire of indignation when he
spoke of cruelty or neglect, showing how really repulsive these
things were to him. Then his quiet, almost stealthy, but highly
dramatic imitation of the manner of some singular patient. His
equally finished mode of expressing pain, in the subdued tone of
his voice; and then when something soothing or comfortable had
been successfully administered to a patient, his "Thank you, sir,
thank you, that is very comfortable," was just enough always
to interest, and never to offend. Now and then he would sketch
some patient who had been as hasty as he himself was sometimes
reported to be. "Mr. Abernethy, I am come, sir, to consult
you about a complaint that has given me a great deal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
trouble." "Show me your tongue, sir. Ah, I see your digestive
organs are very wrong." "I beg your pardon, sir;
there you are wrong yourself; I never was better in all my
life," &amp;c. All this, which is nothing in telling, was delivered
in a half-serious, half-Munden-like, humorous manner, and yet so
subdued as never to border on vulgarity or farce.</p>

<p>His mode of relating cases which involved some important
principle, showed how really interested he had been in them. A
gentleman having recovered from a very serious illness, after
having failed a long time in getting relief, was threatened, by the
influence of the same causes, with a return of his malady. "He
thought," said Abernethy, "that if he did not drink deeply, he
might eat like a glutton." He lived in the country, and Mr.
Abernethy one day went and dined with him. "Well," said Mr.
Abernethy, "I saw he was at his old tricks again; so, being a
merchant, I asked him what he would think of a man who,
having been thriving in business, had amassed a comfortable
fortune, and then went and risked it all in some imprudent
speculation?" "Why," said the merchant, "I should think
him a great ass." "Nay, then, sir," said Abernethy, "thou
art the man."</p>

<p>On another occasion, a boy having suffered severely from disease
of the hip, Abernethy had enjoined his father to remove him
from a situation which he was unfitted to fill, and which, from the
exertion it required, would expose him to a dangerous recurrence
of his complaint. The father, however, put the boy back to his
situation. One day, Abernethy met both father and son in
Chancery Lane, and he saw the boy, who had a second time
recovered, again limping in his walk. After making the necessary
inquiry&mdash;"Sir," said he to the father, "did I not warn you not
to place your son in that situation again?" The father admitted
the fact. "Then, sir," said Abernethy, "if that boy
dies, I shall be ready to say you are his murderer." Sure
enough, the boy had another attack, and did die in a horrible
condition.</p>

<p>This story, and others of a similar kind, were intended to impress
the paramount importance of keeping diseased parts, <i>and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
joints especially</i>, in a state of <i>perfect repose</i>; and to prevent a
recurrence of mischief, by avoiding modes of life inappropriate to
constitutions which had exhibited a tendency to this serious class
of diseases.</p>

<p>He was remarkably good on the mode of examining and detecting
the nature of accidents; as fractures and dislocations.
In regard to the latter, he had many very good stories, of which
we will presently cite a ludicrous example. He could, however,
throw in pathos with admirable skill when he desired it. The
following lamentable case he used to tell to an audience singularly
silent. He is speaking of the course of a large artery.</p>

<p>"Ah," said he, "there is no saying too much on the importance
of recollecting the course of large arteries: but I will tell
you a case. There was an officer in the navy, and as brave a
fellow as ever stepped, who in a sea-fight received a severe
wound in the shoulder, which opened his axillary artery. He
lost a large quantity of blood; but the wound was staunched
for the moment, and he was taken below. As he was an officer,
the surgeon, who saw he was wounded severely, was about to
attend him, before a seaman who had just been brought down.
But the officer, though evidently in great pain, said: 'Attend
to that man, sir, if you please; I can wait.' Well, his turn
came; the surgeon made up his mind that a large artery had
been wounded; but, as there was no bleeding, dressed the
wound, and went on with his business. The officer lay very
faint and exhausted for some time, and at length began to rally
again, when the bleeding returned. The surgeon was immediately
called, and, not knowing where to find the artery, or
what else to do, told the officer he must amputate his arm at
the shoulder joint. The officer at once calmly submitted to
this additional, but unnecessary suffering; and, as the operator
proceeded, asked if it would be long. The surgeon replied that
it would soon be over. The officer rejoined: 'Sir, I thank
God for it!' But he never spake more."</p>

<p>Amidst the death-like silence of the class, Abernethy calmly
concluded: "I hope you will never forget the course of the
axillary artery."</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<p>His position was always easy and natural&mdash;sometimes homely,
perhaps. In the Anatomical Lecture, he always stood, and either
leant against the wall, with his hands folded before him, or resting
one hand on the table, with the other perhaps in his pocket. In
his Surgical Lecture, he usually sat, and very generally with one
leg resting on the other.</p>

<p>He was particularly happy in a kind of coziness, or friendliness
of manner, which seemed to identify him with his audience;
as if we were all about to investigate something interesting <i>together</i>,
and not as if we were going to be "Lectured at" at all.
He spoke as if addressing each individual, and his discourse, like
a happy portrait, always seemed to be looking you in the face.
On very many accounts, the tone and pitch of the voice, in lecturing,
are important. First: That it may not be inaudible; nor,
on the contrary, too loud. The one of course renders the whole
useless; the other is apt to give an impression of vulgarity. We
recollect a gentleman who was about to deliver a lecture in a theatre
to which he was unaccustomed. He was advised to ascertain the
loudness required, and to place a friend in the most distant part,
to judge of its fitness; but he declined it as unnecessary. When
he had given the lecture, which was a very good one, on a very
interesting subject, he was much mortified in finding that he had
been inaudible to at least one half of the audience.</p>

<p>Abernethy was very successful in this respect. His voice
seldom rose above what we may term the conversational, either
in pitch or tone; it was, in general, pleasing in quality, and enlivened
by a sort of archness of expression. His loudest tone
was never oppressive to those nearest to him; his most subdued,
audible everywhere. The <i>range</i> of pitch was very limited; the
expression of the eye, and a <i>slight modulation</i> of the voice being
the means by which he infused through the lecture an agreeable
variety, or gave to particular sentiments the requisite expression.
There was nothing like declamation; even quotations were seldom
louder than would have been admissible in a drawing-room. We
have heard lecturers whose habitually declamatory tone has been
very disagreeable; and this seldom fails to be mischievous. A
declamatory tone tends to divert the attention, or to weary it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
when properly directed. On almost every subject, it is sure to be
the source of occasional bathos, which now and then borders on
the ridiculous. Conceive a man, describing a curious animal in
a diagram, saying, "This part, to which I now direct my rod, is
the point of the tail," in a sepulchral tone, and heavy cadence,
as if he had said, "This is the end of all things." Another inconvenience
often attending a declamatory tone, as distinguished
from the narrative or descriptive, is the tendency it has to make
a particular cadence. Sometimes we have heard lecturers give
to every other sentence a peculiar fall; and this succession of
rhythmical samenesses, if the lecturer be not otherwise extremely
able, sends people napping.</p>

<p>Another fault we observe in some lecturers is, a reiteration of
particular phrases. In description, it is not easy always to avoid
this; but it seldom occurred in any disagreeable degree in Abernethy.
We have heard some lecturers, in describing things,
continually reiterating such phrases as "We find," "It is to be
observed," in such quick and frequent succession, that people's
sides began to jog in spite of them.</p>

<p>Provincial or national idiom, or other peculiarity, is by no
means uncommon, and generally more or less disagreeable, Abernethy
was particularly free from either. He could, in telling
stories, slightly imitate the tone and manner of the persons concerned;
but it was always touched in the lightest possible manner,
and with the subdued colouring and finish of a first-rate artist.
His power of impressing facts, and of rendering them simple and
interesting by abundance and variety of illustration, was very
remarkable, and had the effect of imparting an interest to the
driest subject. In the first place, he had an agreeable mode of
sympathizing with the difficulty of the student. If he were about
to describe a bone or anything which he knew to be difficult, he
would adopt a tone more like that in which a man would teach it
to himself than describe it to others. For example, he would
say, perhaps: "Ah! this is a queer-looking bone; it has a very
odd shape; but I plainly perceive that one may divide it into two
parts." Then pointing with a probe to the division he proposed,
he would begin, not so much to <i>describe</i> as to <i>find</i>, as if for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
first time, the various parts of which he wished to teach the names
and uses; the description being a kind of running accompaniment
to his tracing of the bone, and in a tone as if half-talking
to himself and half to the audience.</p>

<p>Every one feels the value of order, and clearness of arrangement.
Of Abernethy's, we have already spoken generally: simplicity,
and impressing the more essential facts, were his main
objects. He showed very frequently his perception of the importance
of order, and would often methodize for the students.
He knew very well that A B C was much more easily remembered
than Z K J; and he would sometimes humorously contrast
the difference between a man whose knowledge was well
packed, and one whose information was scattered and without
arrangement. This he usually did by supposing two students
under examination. The scene would not <i>tell</i> upon paper; but
it never failed to create a good deal of mirth in the theatre, during
which he would contrive to repeat the facts he meant to impress,
without the tedium of mere reiteration.</p>

<p>Various people have been more or less deeply impressed with
different parts of his lectures, most persons having their favourite
passages. In his anatomical course we were never more pleased
than by his <i>general</i> view of the structure of the body. He adopted
on that occasion the synthetical plan, and in imagination put the
various parts together which were to be afterwards taught analytically.
In his surgical course, the manner in which he illustrated the
practical points, and his own views in the "Eventful History of
a Compound Fracture," was, we think, the most successful
triumph, both as to matter and manner, which we have ever
witnessed.</p>

<p>An abundance of resource and manœuvres of the kind we
have mentioned, gave a great "liveliness" to his lecture, which
<i>in its quiet form so as not to divert or disturb</i>, is a great difficulty
in lecturing.</p>

<p>We have heard an excellent lecturer whose only fault, we
think, was want of liveliness and variety. Few men could in
other respects lecture comparably to him. Nothing could surpass
the quiet, polished manner of this accomplished teacher.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
His voice, though not good, was by no means unpleasing. His
articulation elaborately distinct, and free from all provincialism.
His language invariably correct and appropriate; the structure
of his sentences strikingly grammatical; and they fell in such an
easy, though somewhat too rhythmical succession, as to be at
once graceful and melodious. His arrangement, always simple
and clear. Nothing was more striking than the deferential manner
in which he approached a philosophical subject. "I like &mdash;&mdash;,"
said one who had often heard him, "because he is always so
gentlemanly. There is nothing off-hand, as if he thought
himself very clever, but a kind of unaffected respect for himself
and his audience, which obliges one to pay attention to him, if
it were only because you feel that a man of education is
speaking to you."</p>

<p>What, it may be said, can such a man want? Why he
wanted liveliness and flexibility. His voice measured forth its
gentlemanly way with all the regularity of a surveying rod.
Various and interesting as his subjects were, and handled with
consummate ability, he must certainly have <i>taught</i>; yet we think
he sent away many of his audience passive recipients, as distinguished
from persons <i>set on thinking</i> what they had heard
"into their own."</p>

<p>He performed his task like a good man and a scholar; but
still it was like a task after all. It was something like a scholar
reading a book, always excepting the beautifully clear illustrations
for which his subject gave him abundant opportunity. He wanted
that animation and interest in his subject by which a lecturer
inoculates you with his own enthusiasm. He was the most
striking example in our experience of the importance of liveliness
and variety, and of making a lecture, however well delivered, just
that thing which we <i>cannot</i> find in a book. The life-like, the
dramatic effect was wanting; and it was to this alone that we can
ascribe what we have not unfrequently observed in the midst of a
generally attentive audience, a few who were "nodding" their
assent to his propositions.</p>

<p>Now Abernethy's manner was perfect in these respects. He
had just got the "cheerfully, not too fast" expression, that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
sometimes see at the head of a musical composition. His manner
was so good, that it is difficult to convey any idea of it. It was
easy, without being negligent; cheerful, without being excited;
humorous, often witty, without being vulgar; expeditious, without
being in a bustle; and he usually took care that you should learn
<i>the thing</i>, before he gave the <i>name of it</i>; and understand it, before
he expatiated on the beauty or perfection of its adaptation to the
ends it seemed designed to serve.</p>

<p>He was particularly chaste in the manner in which he spoke
of design, or other of the Attributes so frequently observable in
natural arrangements. It is a great mistake, we think, and not
without something akin to vulgarity, to usher in any description
of the beauties of nature by a flourish of such trumpets as
human epithets form&mdash;mere notes of admiration. Nature speaks
best for herself. The mind is kept in a state of excitement by
too frequent <i>feux de joies</i> of this kind; the frequent recurrence
of such terms as "curious! strange! wonderful!" on subjects
where all is wonderful, have a sort of bathos in the ears of the
judicious, while to the less critical they produce a kind of disturbed
atmosphere, which is unfavourable to the calm operations
of the intellect.</p>

<p>Abernethy was generally very careful in these matters. I
give one example. He is speaking of cartilage, or gristle, which
covers the ends of the bones where they form joints, and has
explained its great elasticity, the use of it in preventing jarring;
and contrasted the <i>springiness</i> of youth with the easily jarred
frame of age. "Well," he adds, "this cartilage is fibrous, and
they say that the fibres are arranged vertically; so that the
body may be said to be supported on '<i>myriads of elastic
columns</i>.'" That was the beauty by which he wished to impress
that which he had previously <i>taught</i>.</p>

<p>When marvellousness is too much excited, many say, "Ah,
how clever that gentleman is! what an interesting lecture!
what a curious thing that was he showed us!" But when you
inquire what <i>principle</i> or <i>law</i> was intended to be illustrated, you find
that the sensual or the imaginative faculty has alone been excited,
and has galloped off with that which was intended for the intellect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
If persons are examined as to a particular point of the lecture,
they are apt to say: "Well, that is just what I wanted to know;
would you explain it?"</p>

<p>It would seem that it is a great mistake to excite marvellousness
or our external senses very vividly, when we desire to concentrate
the intellectual faculties. That breathless silence, with
eyes and mouth open, that "<i>intenti que ora tenebant</i>" condition,
excited by marvellousness, is very well for the story of Æneas, or
Robinson Crusoe; but it is out of place, when we are endeavouring
to augment our intellectual possessions.</p>

<p>We require, in fact, a calmer atmosphere. The desire to
interest and hold the attention of our audience is so natural, that
it is very apt to escape one that this may be done <i>on terms not
consistent</i> with our real object&mdash;the interesting the intellect; and
this fault is perhaps, of all, the worst; because it is never a greater
failure than when it appears to be successful. All other faults
in lecturing, if serious, in one respect tell their own tale in the
thinning audience.</p>

<p>The learned author of the "Philosophy of Rhetoric" has
observed that "A discourse directed to the understanding will
not admit of an address to the passions, which, as it never fails
to disturb the operation of the intellectual faculty, must be
regarded by every intelligent hearer as foreign indeed, if not
insidious." He had before said, "that in such a discourse you
may borrow metaphor or comparison to illustrate it, but not
the bolder figures, prosopopœia and the like, which are intended
not to elucidate the subject, but to <i>create admiration</i>."</p>

<p>"It is obvious," he continues, "that either of the foregoing,
far from being subservient to the main design (to address the
intellect), serves only to distract the attention from it<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor"><sup>67</sup></a>."</p>

<p>This judicious writer, however, in the first sentence makes a
distinction, which requires, perhaps, to be received with some
caution.</p>

<p>There is no discourse that is solely intellectual; the driest
mathematical proposition interests our <i>feelings</i>. The pleasure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
truth, what is that? Not merely intellectual, certainly. It is a
pleasure derived <i>from</i> the intellect, no doubt; but it is a <i>feeling</i>
entirely distinct. So, in addresses to the passions, if they are
successful, the presiding influence of the intellect is very obvious;
this away, a discourse soon merges into bombast or fustian, a
something which neither impresses the feelings nor the passions
as desired.</p>

<p>The true desideratum, as it appears to us, is accuracy of adjustment,
not separation. In intellectual operations, the feelings
are to be subservient to the accomplishment of the objects of the
intellect. In discourses, where the passions or feelings are most
appealed to, or most prominent, the intellect must still really
guide, though it may appear to follow.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that so much of Abernethy's lecturing was
on anatomy, and therefore necessarily addressed to the eye, yet he
seldom offered any <i>illustration</i> to the external senses. He was
always endeavouring to impress the mechanical arrangement of
parts, by reference to their uses and surgical relations. Even in
speaking of light, he would be suggestive beyond the mere perception
of sense. He used to say, of refraction of light, when
the refracting medium was, as it commonly is, the denser body,
"that the ray seems as if attracted"&mdash;a very suggestive phrase to
any one who has thought much on the subject of light. It is a
curious thing to observe how confused the ideas of many people
are on phenomena of light; and we are afraid that the cause is,
that the illustrations to the eye are given <i>too soon</i>. If people
were made to <i>understand</i> by a simple illustration what they are
about to <i>see</i>, it is probable they would have much clearer ideas.
The intellect having gone before, the eye no longer diverts it from
its office; and the eye would then be merely <i>impressing</i>, by means
of a physical representation, an established idea.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>Abernethy's humour was very peculiar; and though there
was of course something in the matter, there was a good deal
more, as it appeared to us, in the manner. The secret of humour,
we apprehend, lies in the juxtaposition, either expressed or implied,
of incongruities, and it is not easy to conceive anything humourous
which does not involve these conditions. We have sometimes
thought there was just this difference in the humour of
Abernethy, as contrasted with that of Sidney Smith. In Smith's,
there was something that, told by whom it might be, was always
ludicrous. Abernethy's generally lay in the telling.</p>


<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"The jest's propriety lies in the ear</div>
<div class="i0">Of him who hears it, never in the tongue</div>
<div class="i0">Of him that makes it,"</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>although true, was still to be taken in rather a different sense
from that in which it is usually received. The former (a far
higher species of humour) may be recorded; the dramatic necessities
of the other occasion it to die with the author. The
expression Abernethy threw into his humour (though of course
without that broadness which is excusable in the drama, but which
would have been out of place in a philosophical discourse) was
a quiet, much-subdued colouring, between the good-nature of
Dowton, and (a little closer perhaps to the latter) the more quiet
and gentlemanly portions of Munden.</p>

<p>Few old pupils will forget the story of the Major who had
dislocated his jaw.</p>

<p>This accident is a very simple one, and easily put right; but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
having once happened, it is apt to recur on any unusual extension
of the lower jaw. Abernethy used to represent this as a frequent
occurrence with an hilarious Major; but as it generally happened
at mess, the surgeon went round to him and immediately put it
in again. One day, however, the Major was dining about fourteen
miles from the regiment, and, in a hearty laugh, "out went
his jaw." They sent for the medical man, whom, said Abernethy,
we must call the apothecary. Well, at first, he thought that the
jaw was dislocated; but he began to pull and to show that he
knew nothing about the proper mode of putting it right again.
On this, the Major appeared to be very excited, and vociferated
inarticulately in a strange manner; when, all at once, the doctor,
as if he had just hit on the nature of the case, suggested that
the Major's complaint was in his brain, and that he could not be
in his right mind. On hearing this, the Major became furious,
which was regarded as confirmatory of the doctor's opinion; they
accordingly seized him, confined him in a strait-waistcoat and put
him to bed, and the doctor ordered that the barber should be
sent for to shave the head, and a blister to be applied "to the
part affected."</p>

<p>The Major, fairly beaten, ceased making resistance, but made
the best signs his situation and his imperfect articulation allowed,
for pen and paper. This request, being hailed as indicative of
returning rationality, was complied with; and, as soon as he was
sufficiently freed from his bonds, he wrote&mdash;"For God's sake
send for the surgeon of the regiment." This was accordingly
done, and the jaw readily reduced, as it had been often before.
"I hope," added Abernethy, "you will never forget how to reduce
a dislocated jaw."</p>

<p>We think that what we have said of the style of his humour
cannot be very incorrect, from knowing that the impressions of
one of his oldest pupils and greatest admirers were almost identical
with the foregoing. I recollect it being said of John Bannister,
that the reason his acting pleased everybody was that he
was always a gentleman; an extremely difficult thing, we should
imagine, in handling some of the freer parts of our comic dialogues.
Abernethy's humour (exceptionally indeed, but occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
a little broad) never suggested the idea of vulgarity; and, as
we have said, every joke had its mission. Then, at times, though
there was not much humour, yet a promptness of repartee gave
it that character.</p>

<p>"Mr. Abernethy," said a patient, "I have something the
matter, sir, with this arm. There, oh! (making a particular
motion with the limb) that, sir, gives me great pain." "Well,
what a fool you must be to do it, then," said Abernethy.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting facts in relation to Abernethy's
lecturing, was, that however great his natural capacity, he certainly
owed very much to careful study and practice; and we cannot
but think that it is highly encouraging to a more careful education
for this mode of teaching, to know the difficulty that even such
a man as Abernethy had for some few years in commanding his
self-possession. To those who only knew him in his zenith or
his decline, this will appear extraordinary; yet, to a careful
observer, there were many occasions when it was easy to see that
he did not appear so entirely at ease <i>without some effort</i>. He was
very impatient of interruption; an accidental knock at the door
of the theatre, which, by mistake of some stranger, would occasionally
happen, would disconcert him considerably; and once,
when he saw some pupil joking or inattentive, he stopped, and
with a severity of manner I hardly ever saw before or afterwards,
said: "If the lecture, sir, is not interesting to you, I must beg
you to walk out."</p>

<p>There were, as we shall hereafter observe, perhaps physical
reasons for this irritability. He never hesitated, as we occasionally
hear lecturers do, nor ever used any notes. When he came to
any part that he perhaps wished to impress, he would pause and
think for a second or two, with his class singularly silent. It was
a fine moment. We recollect being once at his lecture with the
late Professor Macartney, who had been a student of Abernethy's<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor"><sup>68</sup></a>.
Macartney said, "what can it be that enables him to give so much
interest to what we have so often heard before?" We believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
it to have been nothing but a steady observance of rules, combined
with an admirable power <i>matured by study</i>.</p>

<p>That which, above everything, we valued in the whole of
Abernethy's lectures, was what can hardly be expressed otherwise
than by the term, tone. With an absence of all affectation, with
the infusion of all sorts of different qualities: with humour,
hilarity, lively manner, sometimes rather broad illustrations, at
other times, calm and philosophical, with all the character of deep
thought and acute penetration; indignation at what was wrong
or unfeeling, and pathos in relation to irremediable calamity;
still the thing which surpassed all, was the feeling, with which he
inoculated the pupils, of a high and conscientious calling. He
had a way which excited enthusiasm without the pupil knowing
why. We are often told by lecturers of the value of knowledge
for various purposes&mdash;for increasing the power and wealth of the
country&mdash;for multiplying the comforts and pleasures of society&mdash;for
amassing fortunes, and for obtaining what the world usually
means by the term distinction. But Abernethy created a feeling
distinct from and superior to all mere utilitarian purposes. He
made one feel the mission of a conscientious surgeon to be a high
calling, and spurned, in manner as well as matter, the more trite
and hackneyed modes of inculcating these things. You had no
set essay, no long speeches. The <i>moral</i> was like a golden thread
artfully interwoven in a tissue to which it gives a diffusive lustre;
which, pervading it everywhere, is obtrusive nowhere.</p>

<p>For example, the condition attached to the performance of our
lowest duties (operations), were, the well-ascertained inefficacy of
our best powers directed to judicious treatment; the <i>crowning</i>
test&mdash;the conviction that, placed in the same circumstances, <i>we
would have the same operation performed on ourselves</i>. Much
of the suggestive lies in these directions. Our sympathies toward
the victims of mistake or ignorance, excited by the relation of
their sufferings, were heightened by the additional mention of any
good quality the patient might have possessed, or advantage of
which he might have been deprived; and thus that interest secured
which a bare narration of the case might have failed to awaken.</p>

<p>A father, who, in subservience to the worldly prospects of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
son, placed him in a situation to which he was unequal, and thus
forgot his first duty, the health of his offspring, was the "murderer"
of his child. Another victim, we have seen, was as
"brave a fellow as ever stepped," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Humanity and Science went hand in hand. His method of
<i>discovering</i> the nature of dislocations and fractures, by attention
to the relative position of parts, was admirable; and few of his
pupils, who have had much experience, have failed to prove the
practical excellence of them. He repudiated nothing more than
the too commonly regarded test, in fractures, of "grating, or
crepitus." Nothing distinguished his examination of a case
more than his gentleness, unless it was the clearness with which
he delivered his opinion.</p>

<p>To show how important gentleness is&mdash;a surgeon had a
puzzling case of injury to the elbow. He believed that he knew
the nature of the accident, and that he had put the parts right;
but still the joint remained in a half-straight position; and the
surgeon, who knew his business, became alarmed, lest something
had escaped him, and that the joint would be stiff. He proposed
a consultation. The joint was examined with great gentleness,
and after Abernethy's plan. The boy experienced no pain.
Everything appeared in its natural position. The surgeon said:
"Now, my boy, bend your arm a little, but no farther than just
to reach my finger; and not as much as that, if it gives you
any pain." This the boy did very gently. After waiting a
few minutes, the surgeon again told him to bend it a little
more, and upon the same conditions; and so on, until, in a
very short space of time&mdash;perhaps eight or ten minutes&mdash;the arm
had been completely bent. The boy had been alarmed, and the
muscles had become so sensitive that they held the parts with the
most painful tenacity; but, beyond this, there was nothing the
matter.</p>

<p>We cannot help thinking that Abernethy's benevolence had
a great influence in directing some of his happiest contributions
to practice. We consider that every sufferer with that serious accident,
fracture of the neck of the thigh bone within the joint, owes a
great portion of any recovery he may have, to Abernethy. It was he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
who was the real means of overthrowing a dangerous dogma, that
such cases could not unite by bone, and who opposed the practice
consequent on it, by which reparation by bone became impossible.
There was hardly any subject which he touched, of which he did
not take some view more or less original; and his reasoning was
always particularly simple and to the point. No man, we believe,
ever exceeded him in the skill he possessed in conveying ideas
from one mind into another; but he did a great deal more: those
who really studied him were sent away thinking, and led to
work with a kind of pleasure, which was in some sense distinct
from any merely practical or professional interest.</p>

<p>He contrived to imbue you with the love of philosophical
research in the abstract&mdash;with an interest in truth for its own
sake; you found yourself remembering the bare facts, not so
much from conscious <i>efforts</i> of memory, as from the suggestive
interest of the observations with which they were so frequently
associated. In going over one of his Lectures alone, they seem
to grow and expand under your own reflections. We know not
how to express the effect they produced: they seemed to give
new pleasure on repetition, to purify your thoughts scarcely less
than they animated your onward studies.</p>

<p>In studying their more suggestive passages, you would now
and then feel surprise at the number and variety of important
practical relations arising out of a single proposition. We are
here merely stating our own early impressions of his power. What
we always really felt was, that, great as was the excellence of these
Lectures in a scientific or professional sense, there was something
more excellent still in the element they contained of intellectual
expansion and of moral improvement.</p>

<p>We cannot indeed say that they had no faults; but we should
be hard driven to point them out: and although we feel how short
our attempt to give some idea of his mode of proceeding must
fall of doing him justice, still, if there be any truth at all in our
representation, it is quite clear that his negative excellences alone
must have implied no ordinary powers. But we must conclude:
"Quid multa? istum audiens equidem sic judicare soleo; quidquid
aut addideris aut mutaveris aut detraxeris, vitiosius et
deterius futurum."</p>

<p>If a moralist were to divide his catalogue of immoralities
into such as were of general commission, and such as occurred
in the conduct of the various trades and professions, we fear the
latter division would suggest no flattering position to humanity.
An elevation somewhat above gifted creatures it might be; but
still we fear it would be at so low a level as to afford Man but a
humiliating indication of the height from which he had fallen.
He would, in too many instances, perhaps, find his real <i>claims</i>
to his high destiny about equal to the shadowy difference between
a creature who fulfils <i>some</i> only of his responsibilities, and one
who has no responsibilities to fulfil. We should like to hear
some grave philosopher discourse on Fashion: it is surely a
curious thing, for there is a fashion in everything. It is very
like habit; but it is not habit neither. Habit is a garment,
which takes some time to fit easily, and is then not abandoned
without difficulty. Fashion is a good fit <i>instanter</i>, but is thrown
aside at once without the smallest trouble. The most grotesque
or absurd custom which slowly-paced habit bores us with examining,
is at once adopted by fashion with a characteristic assentation.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p>Morals are by no means free from this kind of conventionalism:
so much the contrary, that few things evince more strongly
the power of fashion. It might be imagined that the multiplication
of examples would tend to teach the true nature of the thing
exemplified; but it would not seem so with error; "<i>tout au contraire</i>."
Arts or acts, which are tabooed as vicious in the singular
number, become, in the plasticity of our moral grammars, very
tolerable in the plural. Things that the most hardy shrink from
perpetrating <i>single-handed</i>, are regarded as easy "compliances
with custom" when "joint-stock" vices; practices which, when
partial, men are penetrating enough to discover to be unchristian,
or sufficiently sensitive to regard as ungentlemanly, pass muster
with marvellous lubricity when they become universal. We can
anathemize, with self-complacent indignation, vices in which we
have no share; but we are abundantly charitable when we discuss
those in which we have a common property; and, finally, moral
accounts are settled very much to our own satisfaction, as Butler
says, by compounding</p>


<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i8">"For sins we are inclined to,</div>
<div class="i0">By damning those we have no mind to."</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>After all, society keeps a pretty good "look-out" after
offences distributed in common. The law is tolerably comprehensive
of things which are of general commission; and mankind,
sooner or later, contrive to catch, or successfully oppose,
the numerous little enormities which slip through the finest of
our legal meshes.</p>


<div lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<div class="center">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Raro antecedentem scelestum,</div>
<div class="i0">Deseruit pede pœna claudo."</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>From all this it results that moral obliquities, which fall within
the observation of society, make but an up-hill game; that
which is <i>felt</i> to be prejudicial to the interests of all men, is easily
determined to be vicious. But here again there is much in
fashion. Society has often determined that the immorality of a
thing is not to be measured by the nature of the act, nor the
motive even on which it has been founded, so much as by the
more refined test afforded by the <i>position</i> of the <i>actor</i>. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
man may, like a sort of commercial megatherium, gorge, with
railway velocity, provisions which a once-breathing, fond affection
and a cold world had alike determined to be the life-blood
of widows and orphans, and yet have noblemen and others for
his associate! he may perhaps be a legislator in a great nation;
whilst the poor starveling, who steals for the vulgar purpose of
satisfying hunger, may be sent to the treadmill, where he may
solve at leisure the problem thus set him, by "the most enlightened
nation on earth."</p>

<p>Again, vices which have a known influence in disturbing the
relations of society are in various ways opposed by the more
<i>public</i> influence of religion. So that in the end a man finds&mdash;although
he may arrive at the conclusion, only by exhausting all
other views before he hits on those which lead to it&mdash;that honesty
is as good a way of getting on as any other; or he may advance
perhaps even on this utilitarian creed so far as to agree with
Tillotson: that people take more trouble to get to Hell, than
would suffice to carry them to Heaven. The immoralities of
trades and professions lie in a very different position, and involve
peculiarities which favour their growth and perpetuity.</p>

<p>They are committed in secret;&mdash;people are proverbially cautious
of attacking the weak positions of others, who feel that
their own are ill-defended. This, and the established manœuvres
of each calling, enable an individual to do a good deal "off his
own bat," without, as one of our bishops happily expressed it,
"being caught out." In trade we are sometimes informed that
a thing cannot be sold cheaper; that the price asked is already
less than the cost; and people are appropriately addressed as
idiots, who every day appear to believe that which common sense
shows to be impossible.</p>

<p>Your purveyors will sometimes tell you that they are not
living by the prices they charge; although you have just ascertained
that the same article may be bought at infinitely less cost
in the next market. The other day, a watchmaker told us that
our watch wanted a good deal of looking to, and, amongst other
things, "no doubt cleaning;" but this he discovered, we suppose,
by some recondite mesmeric process in a book, which recorded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
when it had been cleaned last, without looking at the watch at
all.</p>

<p>As regards professions, lawyers are said to defend right and
wrong with indiscriminate avidity, with the encouraging prospect
of obtaining more fruit in maintaining one wrong cause, than
establishing twenty right.</p>

<p>Then the <i>real nature</i> of these things is, like too many in other
sciences, obscured by a cloudy nomenclature. We hear of
"customs of the trade," "secrets of the trade," or "profession,"
applied to things which the moralist only recognizes under very
different designations. Sophisms thus secured, and which appear
to minister to a man's interests, have their true colours developed
with difficulty; to say nothing of it not being easy to discover
that which there is no desire to examine.</p>

<p>If any man should be so "peculiar," or "crotchety," as to
consider that names are of little import, and that "Vice is vice,
for a' that," and venture to anathematize any custom, or even
refuse to be an accessory, in declining to wink at it, he may
encounter charges of violating professional confidence, of being
deficient in a proper <i>esprit de corps</i>, and be outvoted, for no
better reason than that he cannot concur in the dogma, that a
<i>vicious sophism is more valuable than a simple truth</i>; nor agree
with the currier, "that leather is the best material for fortification."
He may possibly be let off by conceding his connivance;
which is little better than declining to be thief, as too shocking;
but having no objection to the more lubricated position of the
receiver.</p>

<p>But does any one for one moment believe that all this can be
hung on any trade, or profession, with no effect? Or that it
will not have a baneful influence on every calling, and that in
proportion as its <i>real</i> and <i>proper</i> duties are beneficent and exalted?
Now, whilst we claim for the medical profession a character
which, in its single-mindedness and benevolence, yields to
no other whatever, we fear it is not entirely free from these
technical besettings.</p>

<p>In the medical profession, we trust, that which we, for want of
a better term, designate as technical immoralities are exceptions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
Exceptional they may be, and we sincerely hope they are; but,
in a crowded island, exceptions, even if <i>relatively</i> few, may be
<i>absolutely</i> numerous; and whenever they occur, especially if men
hold any position, one case of compromise of duty does more
harm than a hundred of the most inflexible adhesions to it can
remedy. Suppose a patient apply to a surgeon with a complaint
requiring one operation, and his fears incline him to another; he
is informed it is improper for his case: that so far from relieving
him, it will indefinitely increase his sufferings. The patient
reiterates his wishes; the surgeon declines doing that which he
would not have done in his own person. On lamenting what he
believes to be the consequences of the patient's determination, to
a brother surgeon, he is met by: "What a fool you must be to
throw away &mdash;&mdash; guineas; if you don't do it, somebody else
will."</p>

<p>He is too right in his prediction, and so is the surgeon who
refused to operate, and he has lost a large fee; he receives the
verification of his prediction subsequently from the patient, who
exclaims, "Sir, I never have a moment's ease!" and when, after
weeks of suffering, the patient dies, the surgeon consoles himself
with the melancholy satisfaction of not having contributed to
sufferings which he was called in too late to remedy.</p>

<p>The more plastic practitioner has, it is true, taken fifty or a
hundred guineas, it may be, out of the one pocket, and put it
into his own; but in what way are mankind benefited? or does
any one really think that the apparent gainer can ultimately be
so? The fault in this, as in many other cases, is the ignorance
of the public. There is nothing in the foregoing sketch that
was not as easily intelligible to the commonest understanding, as
that two and two are equal to four! And is it no evil that one
man should pay so large a sum for so plain a piece of honesty?
or that another should be rewarded, as the case may be, for
ignorance, or a compromise of his duty?</p>

<p>Let us take another case. A gentleman was called on to
give a certificate; he examined the case, and found that the
wording of the certificate called on him to certify to that which
was diametrically opposite to the fact. He naturally declined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
and, as the point was of some importance, went to the parties to
explain. He was then informed that two professional men had,
the previous day, given the certificate without hesitation. He is
complimented on his conscientiousness, but never employed again
by that family; and he has the further satisfaction of hearing
that his place is supplied by one of his more accommodating
brethren! We fear that in such a case there is a balance to be
adjusted between the several persons, and an appropriate appellation
to be discovered besides. We respectfully leave it to the
reader's judgment to adjust the one, and to draw on his aptitude
for nomenclature to supply the other.</p>

<p>Again, a man is called in to a consultation; he disapproves
of the treatment, but declares to the friends of the patient that
every thing has been very properly done. In another case of
consultation, finding that every thing has been really conducted
properly, he commences an <i>apparently</i> different treatment, but
essentially the same, without giving his confiding brother the
benefit which his acquiescence in his views would necessarily
imply.</p>

<p>In an operation, where the course is doubtful and the opinion
various, the choice is left to the patient&mdash;that is, the decision of
how the surgeon is to act is to be determined by him who is confessedly
really least capable of judging. Can it be right to perform
a <i>doubtful</i> operation under such circumstances? Should
not the patient reflect that the <i>temptations</i> are all on one side?
The attempt to dispense with the operation is laborious, time-consuming,
anxious, encouraged perhaps only by small, minute
accessions of improvement, interspersed with complaints of tedium
and delay, and the result admitted to be doubtful; the operation,
on the other hand, is a work of a few minutes, the remuneration
munificent, the <i>éclat</i> productive, and the labour nothing. All
this and much more no man can entirely prevent; the real cause
is the ignorance of the public, which a very little of the labour
they bestow on many far less important subjects would easily
and quickly dispel.</p>

<p>If these and multitudes of similar things are evils; if they
contribute to debase a profession and to charge the conscientious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
with unthankful office and unrequited labour, and to confer fame
and profit on a triumphant chicanery; we surely must feel indebted&mdash;not
only as professional men, not merely as patients,
but in a far higher and wider sense&mdash;to a man who, availing
himself of a commanding position for the highest purposes,
endeavoured, by precept and example, to oppose all such proceedings,
and to cultivate a high <i>morale</i> in the conduct of the profession.
Now no one more sedulously aimed at this than John
Abernethy. Although we shall not, we trust, be accused of
underrating the obligations we owe him in a professional or
scientific sense, we think that, great as they are, they are at least
equalled by those arising out of that duty-to-your-neighbour spirit
which was so universally diffused through every thing he taught,
and which, in his intercourse with his pupils, he never on any
occasion failed to inculcate. We will endeavour to render what
we mean intelligible, and perhaps we cannot do this better than
by selecting a few illustrations from observation of "Abernethy
in Consultation."</p>

<p>Consultation. We are to have a consultation! What a
sound is that! How many a heart has been set thumping by
this one word. We doubt whether there be any in the English
language that has more frequently disturbed the current it was
intended to calm. But consultations must be. Already the
carriage of a physician has arrived, a tremendous rap has been
given at the door, the interesting visitor is already in the library.</p>

<p>Another rap, louder somewhat than the former, announces
another physician, or a consulting surgeon. The general practitioner,
taking advantage of his intimacy with the family, may
have perhaps very sensibly walked in without knocking at all.
They are now all assembled in the library, and, having remarked
on a "Storm Scene" by Gaspar Poussin, which hangs over the
fire-place, we leave them to the preliminaries of a consultation.</p>

<p>Presently they are introduced to the patient, on whom the
knocking has already had some effect. A short pause, and they
are again assembled in the library. In a few minutes the bell
rings, and the father of a fine young woman is summoned to hear
their decision. As he proceeds, he stealthily removes a straggling
tear that, with all care, would get out of bounds, enters the
library, and hears the result of the consultation. Neatly enveloped
<i>honoraria</i> are presented to the consultants, the bell has rung,
Thomas has shown the gentlemen to their respective vehicles, and
and so ends the consultation.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>The father, a widower, returns to the drawing-room, and his
second daughter says: "Well, papa, what do the doctors say of
Emily?" "Well, my dear, they say that Emily is very ill; that
she requires great care; that they cannot say positively, but hope
she may ultimately do well. They entirely coincide with our
friend Mr. Smith Jones as to the nature of the disease, and
think his treatment of the case has been highly judicious. They
say there are some points on which the case may turn, but of
which they cannot speak positively to-day; but they hope to be
able to do so when they meet again, which they are to do the
day 'after to-morrow.' They all seem to consider the nervous
system very much affected. They say we must keep Emily very
quiet. She is to have any light diet she desires, and to have some
new medicine to-morrow. The cod-liver oil, they say, has done
her all the good now that it is calculated to do, and she is this
evening to take a composing draught." The family are silent,
and so ends the consultation.</p>

<p>What! and are all consultations like that? No, reader, we
hope not. Many a valuable life has, we believe, been saved or
prolonged by consultation; and perhaps many more would be, if
people would only <i>think a little more before</i> they act in such
important matters.</p>

<p>But how is this to be, when men and women who <i>do</i> think
will dive into all other branches of knowledge, more or less, and
neglect all inquiry into laws, a <i>general</i> knowledge of which may
easily be acquired, and of which ignorance is so frequently visited
by no less punishment than the premature separation of our
dearest ties, and the loss or impairment of that which is acknowledged
to be the first of temporal blessings. There are many
things in consultations, which require putting right, which do
not depend on any one man, or on any one class. What are we
to say to a man who admits the ability, and approves of the
investigative power and practice of another, but who cannot call
him in because he <i>orders so little medicine</i>? Or of the mode in
which the public treat another, who, wishing to practise as a
gentleman, and to be paid for his brains rather than his bottles,
makes no charge for the latter; and yet who informed us that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
having tried this for three years, he lost so many families by it,
that if he had not relinquished the plan, he should have wanted
bread for his own? Or who shall we blame, when one man,
calling in another to a patient, finds that the other feels no
scruple in repaying the <i>prestige</i> which he thus owes to his confiding
brother by taking the patient from him the first opportunity;
albeit that he occupies what should be, and, we trust, as
the rule is, a higher walk in the profession.</p>

<p>We have seen so much feeling arising from this practice, and
we hold it as so serious an error, that we regard it as <i>tending
more than any one thing whatever</i> to injure the position and
character of the consulting branches of the profession.</p>

<p>Again, how inconsiderate must be the adoption of that custom
which first of all institutes an inquiry to ascertain whether there
is any difference of opinion, and yet accompanies it with trammels,
the tendency of which is to oblige men to <i>appear</i> to agree.
When coincidence of opinion is <i>alone safe</i>, who can be expected
to differ? The public have allowed lawyers to differ without that
difference involving any reproach. They have also proverbially
determined that "doctors do." Yet that which they consider as
an almost necessary rule in the one case, in the other they are
very prone to visit, in regard to some one of the dissentients, as a
proof of professional inferiority. A great deal of mischief results
from this state of things; it indefinitely increases the
difficulty of obtaining a <i>really honest</i> and unreserved opinion, and
leads to other consequences which tend to impair that mutual
confidence between man and man, which should be the very life-blood
of a fine profession.</p>

<p>We recollect a case, on the nature of which two surgeons
were consulted; and when the patient&mdash;a young lady&mdash;had been
withdrawn, the <i>father</i> requested to know if there were any objection
to his being present at the conference. The surgeon to whom he
seemed to address himself said, "None on my part;" to which
the other <i>seemed</i> also to assent. When the consultation was
over, the surgeon who had thus <i>seemed</i> to consent addressed the
other, saying: "If ever we meet again, sir, our consultation must
not be in the presence of the friends of the patient." This was said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
in a tone to which the other had not been accustomed; but, as
a lady had just then entered the room, no reply was made. The next
morning, however, the gentleman was called on to re-consider the
tone in which he had thus addressed his brother consultant, when
a satisfactory explanation settled the matter.</p>

<p>Such things, however, are extremely disagreeable, and illustrate
how much more easy it is to go straightforward than by any zigzag
route. What! could not a father hear the honest opinion of two
men concerning his child, until results of the consultation had
been shorn down, certain parts thrown out, and the rest dovetailed
together so as to be made a symmetrical nondescript,
adapted to the requisitions of a vulgar conventionalism?</p>

<p>In another case, in a consultation on a disease as plainly
scrofulous as it was possible to be, the family attendant had pronounced
that it was <i>constitutional</i>, but <i>not</i> scrofula. This was,
it appeared, a miserable assentation to the prejudices of the
family, for the result proved that he knew better. Nevertheless,
a consultation had taken place already with a very eminent
surgeon, without the family being any the wiser in regard to the
nature of the disease. The case not progressing, another surgeon
was consulted, who, being asked what he considered the disease
to be, replied that it was scrofula. Upon this, considerable surprise
and uneasiness were manifested on the part of the family;
and the surgeon, wondering what, in so plain a case, could be the
doubt, took occasion to see the former medical attendant, and to
ask him what he thought of the case; when he said that it was
clearly scrofula, and that he had <i>never known the children</i> of
certain temperaments to which he considered the parents to
belong, wholly without a tendency to that disease; so that he
had all along been blinding the parents, so far as his opinion and
that of another eminent man went, to the real nature of the
malady.</p>

<p>An occurrence, singular, as we hope, took place one day in
consultation, showing how comfortably the most questionable
things may appear to sit on a man's conscience, if only supported
by some <i>supposed</i> sanction from custom. Two surgeons met to
consider a case. They differed as to its nature and treatment; as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
thus&mdash;the one thought a certain remedy necessary, and that any
prospective consequences on its employment merged into the
necessity of the moment; the other thought that remedy wholly
unnecessary, and therefore held even the <i>possibility</i> of any prospective
mischief, an insuperable objection to its use; conceding,
however, that it <i>might</i> possibly, if the treatment were conducted
cautiously, be so managed as to secure the patient from the consequences
in question; and that, if the patient preferred that
course, after the matter had been fairly stated to him, he would
superintend the plan.</p>

<p>Having retired into another room to consult, they were now
again introduced to the patient, when the junior was somewhat
startled to hear his senior begin thus: "Well, sir, we have considered
your case, and we perfectly agree as to the nature of it."
Thinking that this unexpected exordium might possibly be preliminary
to some explanation of the points on which they differed,
the surgeon waited a minute to hear what followed; but
finding that his brother was irremediably misrepresenting the
matter, he said: "Stop, let us understand each other!" and then
stated what had really happened, and the exact nature of their
respective opinions; on which the other, in the coolest manner
possible, said: "Yes&mdash;exactly, you are quite right!" and so
ended the consultation.</p>

<p>There is, no doubt, some fault on all sides. The public are
too uninformed on these important subjects, and therefore do
much that is equally against their own interests and the preservation
of that dignity and respect which should ever attach to a
high-missioned profession. But is the profession itself free from
blame? Do they never themselves minister to this wretched
system of double dealing? We fear there is but one answer to
this question. We are not careful, for obvious reasons, to multiply
examples of such things; but we are convinced that there
must be a change; and since the profession cannot, as too many
of the public may, plead ignorance&mdash;for this and a thousand other
reasons, they should lead the way. We only claim for ourselves
what we readily concede to others&mdash;the expression of our opinion&mdash;when
we say that consultations should be <i>bonâ fide</i> examinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
of the case, and should be followed by <i>bonâ fide intelligible</i>
explanations of it to the <i>patient</i> or his <i>friends</i>, according to the
obvious suggestions of prudence or humanity in the individual
case. When the treatment is correct, the most honest proof
should be afforded of it; namely, the continuance of the plan of
the attendant in ordinary, unobscured by the farce or form of a
prescription; or, if <i>additional</i> appliance only is adopted, in such
a case its subordinate character should be honestly explained.</p>

<p>Where there is difference of view, if it be material, that also
should be candidly stated; and if this be done with <i>real fairness</i>,
our experience has convinced us that it may be effected without
damage to either party. In other differences of opinion, the
public never think it necessary to impute ignorance or incapacity:
let them, <i>for their own sakes</i>, repudiate this construction in regard
to the medical profession. Lastly, let them for ever abandon the
practice of paying any man for his bottles, the number of which
will often be an inverse ratio with his skill and judgment.</p>

<p>To return to Abernethy. No doubt his manner varied in
consultation; but of "Manner" we shall speak in a separate
chapter. We will here record our impressions as to "Abernethy
in consultation;" the conditions which seemed to secure a considerate
opinion from him; the good sense and reasonableness of
those conditions; the practical result of the observance of them,
and the effect they were calculated to produce on the public,
in giving to consultations that efficiency by which they should be
characterized&mdash;an efficiency which <i>every one</i> begins to perceive
to be necessary, and which must be equally to the advantage of
the public and the elevation of the profession.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quidquid enim justum sit id etiam utile esse censent; itemque quod honestum
idem justum, ex quo efficitur, ut quidquid honestum sit idem sit utile</span>."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Cicero.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>The first thing, in consulting Abernethy, if you were a medical
man, was to be clear, and "well up" in the nature of the
case; and the next thing, not to state any opinion, unless you
were prepared to give a good reason for it. These conditions
premised, we never saw any one more unaffectedly deferential to
the opinion of another.</p>

<p>A surgeon took a serious case to him, in which the question
was as to the removal of a large tumour in the neck, which seemed
to be acquiring connections of such depth and importance as to
threaten (should that step be desirable) to render the removal of
it impossible. The patient was advised to allow his surgeon in
ordinary to state his case, and to interrupt him only if he omitted
anything in regard to it within the patient's knowledge. This
was done; the general habits of the patient described, with the
difference which had existed antecedent to the age of thirty, and
subsequently thereto. Mr. Abernethy examined the tumour.</p>

<p>To the <span class="smcap">Surgeon</span>. It is parotid, is it not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Surgeon.</span> I think not, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abernethy</span> (<i>hastily</i>). Why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Surgeon.</span> Because, sir, reflecting on the depth and situation
of the parotid gland, I should hardly expect the tumour to be so
moveable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abernethy.</span> Ah, I see! Very well. (Then to the patient).
Well, sir, I should advise you to attend to your general health,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
and continue to follow Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s advice on that subject. What
I say is&mdash;&mdash; (Then followed a short lecture on the digestive
organs.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patient.</span> Do you think, sir, I shall get rid of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abernethy.</span> Nay, I cannot tell that. But now suppose
you pursue a plan steadily, say for a month, and the tumour does
not increase, will it not be encouraging to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patient.</span> Certainly, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abernethy.</span> Well, then, try it; for if its removal should
become necessary, you will at least be in better condition for the
operation. If it does not get larger, or otherwise inconvenience
you, let it alone.</p>

<p>The patient had heard so much of Abernethy's roughness,
that he came away equally pleased and astonished.</p>

<p>A surgeon took a Colonel in the army to him, with a case
which was progressing fairly, but, as he conceived, in consequence
of the patient not paying so much attention to his health as he
was recommended to do, not so satisfactorily as he desired. The
Colonel briefly stated his case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abernethy.</span> Show me your tongue. Ah! that is bad
enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Colonel.</span> You are quite right there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abernethy.</span> Well, man, I don't require to be told that.</p>

<p>Here the surgeon stated the treatment, which had, in addition
to attention to the general health, involved some local
administrations, of which, in general, Abernethy approved, but,
as it would seem, not in this case. His difference of opinion he
thus stated, in the presence of the patient:</p>

<p>"Well, I say that there is a sufficient disorder of your digestive
organs to maintain the annoyances of which you complain;
and I should confine my attention to endeavour to put that
disorder right. Mr. &mdash;&mdash; seems to think that, in adding to
this treatment the plan he proposes, he will shorten the case.
Well, that may be so; he has paid, I know, a good deal of
attention to this subject; and if I had one of my own family
ill with this complaint, I should feel perfectly satisfied, if they
were under his care. At the same time, I say what I think;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
and if you do not find the general plan successful, then the
means he proposes might with propriety be added."</p>

<p>No harm resulted from this difference of opinion; but much
benefit. The patient was not pleased with Abernethy; but he
thought him very skilful and very honest.</p>

<p>One day, a surgeon went to him under the following circumstances.
A patient who had recently recovered from a lameness,
which, as alleged, had its cause in the foot, on a relapse went to
another surgeon. This gentleman had, as it ultimately appeared,
hastily decided that the lady had a complaint in the hip; she was
therefore consigned to bed, and treated for disease of that part.
After about three months, feeling no better, she desired to see the
surgeon under whose care she had formerly been.</p>

<p>The surgeon was now very much annoyed; for he found that
he had been by many persons charged with having mistaken the
case, which he had never even seen on the second attack, and
which now presented a phase in which disease of the hip, to a
hasty examiner, might easily be suggested. He was not much
better satisfied, when, after a careful examination of the case, he
felt convinced that there was no disease in the hip, although the
symptoms were more severe than ever. He declined undertaking
the case without a previous consultation with the surgeon who
had decided it to be a disease of the hip; but the patient being
immoveable in her opposition to this request, and offering any
other surgeon, or more, if required, her wishes were acceded to,
and Mr. Abernethy requested to visit the case. On going to the
patient, the surgeon explained to Mr. Abernethy the points at
issue, but without telling him to which view his own opinion
inclined, or the positive <i>dictum</i> of his senior brother, a very eminent
surgeon. "I shall, therefore," said he to Abernethy, "feel
particularly obliged to you, sir, if you will examine the case for
yourself."</p>

<p>When they were introduced to the lady, Abernethy said:
"Well, now, I should be very well satisfied with Mr. &mdash;&mdash;'s
report of your case; but he says I must examine the limb for
myself: so here goes."&mdash;A somewhat repulsive beginning to a
delicate lady, perhaps; but nothing could be more cautiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
gentle than his examination. In conducting it, he had avoided
one test which usually <i>does</i> give a little pain. The other surgeon,
deeming the decision to be very important, reminded him of this
test (raising the limb and striking the heel gently), which he then
proceeded to do with equal gentleness. "That will do," said he.
"Now, sir, shall we go into another room?" "No, sir," replied
the surgeon. "If you please, Mr. Abernethy, I should
prefer your at once telling the patient what is your opinion on
the case."</p>

<p>He then declared his opinion; but, fearing he might injure
one or other party, with the following exordium: "Now, madam,
we are all liable to mistakes: there is no man living who does
not make more or less; and I am sure I make mistakes; therefore
I may do so in my opinion of your case. But for the life
of me I cannot perceive that you have any disease in your hip."
He then gave a short, but most lucid view of what he conceived
to be the cause of her pain, and illustrated it by referring to
something which happened to himself in one of his own severe
rheumatic attacks. The result proved that he was quite right as
to his view of the case; the lady, by exercise and other means
(which, had the hip been diseased, would have only exasperated
her complaint), had a good recovery.</p>

<p>One very great charm in Abernethy in consultation was, that
there was no difficulty in getting him to speak out. Some men
are so afraid of being wrong, that they never give you the whole
of their opinion in a case involving any difficulty. It is so obscure,
and followed up by so guarded a prognosis, that it sometimes
amounts to no opinion at all.</p>

<p>Even with surgeons who were very unobjectionable, Abernethy
in his best manner contrasted very favourably. We recollect
being very much struck with this when, very young, we had to
meet Mr. Cline and Mr. Abernethy, within a few days of each
other, in the same case. Mr. Cline was very kind to the patient,
elaborately civil; nor was there anything which could be fairly
regarded as objectionable; but his manner was too artificial; the
contrast in Abernethy was very agreeable. The case was serious,
and (as we thought) hopeless. Abernethy, the moment he saw it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
had his sympathies painfully awakened. Having asked a few
questions, he, in the very kindest manner, said, "Well, I will
tell you what I would do, were I in your situation." He then
proceeded to direct how she should regulate her living, how avoid
mischievous experiments, and went into a rather lengthy series of
directions, in the most unaffected manner, without leaving the
room, or having any private consultation whatever. The lady,
who was a distinguished person, and a very accomplished woman,
was exceedingly pleased with him.</p>

<p>His manner, as we shall by and by admit, was occasionally
rough, and sometimes rather prematurely truthful. One day, he
was called, in consultation, by a physician, to give an opinion on
a case of a pulsating tumour, which was pretty clearly an aneurism.
On proceeding to examine the tumour, he found a plaister
on it. "What is this?" said Abernethy. "Oh! that is a
plaister?" "Pooh!" said Abernethy, taking it off and throwing
it aside. "That was all very well," said the physician;
"but that 'pooh' took several guineas out of my pocket."</p>

<p>On the other hand, he never failed to give the warmest and
most efficient sanction he could to what he conceived to be judicious
treatment on the part of a practitioner with whom he was
in consultation. Mr. Stowe has kindly sent me a very good
example of this; and it illustrates also another very valuable
feature in a consultant: the forbearance from <i>doing anything</i>
where nothing is necessary. A gentleman had met with a severe
accident, a compound dislocation of the ankle, an accident that
Abernethy was the chief means of redeeming from habitual amputation.
The accident happened near Winterslow Hut, on the
road between Andover and Salisbury, and Mr. Davis of Andover
was called in. Mr. Davis placed the parts right, and then said
to the patient, "Now, when you get well, and have, as you most
likely will, a stiff joint, your friends will tell you&mdash; 'Ah! you
had a country doctor.' So, sir, I would advise you to send
for a London surgeon to confirm or correct what I have done."
The patient consented, and sent to London for Abernethy, who
reached the spot by the mail about two in the morning. He
looked carefully at the limb, and saw that it was in a good position,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
and was told what had been done. He then said, "I am
come a long way, sir, to do nothing. I might indeed pretend
to do something; but as any avoidable motion of the limb
must necessarily be mischievous, I should only do harm. You
are in very good hands, and I dare say will do very well. You
may indeed come home with a stiff joint; but that is better
than a wooden leg." He took a cheque for his fee (sixty
guineas), and made his way back to London.</p>

<p>Soon after this, an old clergyman, in the same neighbourhood,
had a violent attack of erysipelas in the head and arm. His
family, becoming alarmed, wrote up to his brother, who resided
near Bedford Row, to request Mr. Abernethy to go down and
visit the patient. Abernethy said, "Who attends your brother?"
"Mr. Davis<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor"><sup>69</sup></a>, of Andover." "Well, I told him all I knew
about surgery, and I <i>know</i> he has not forgotten it. You may
be perfectly satisfied. I shall not go." Here, as Mr. Stowe
observes, he might have had another sixty guineas.</p>

<p>He always felt a great deal of interest about compound dislocations
of the ankle-joint; because of his conviction that amputation,
then so commonly resorted to, was unnecessary. He used
to tell several cases in his lectures. One of them we will briefly
relate here. It was that of a labouring man, who fell off a scaffold
in his own neighbourhood; and, amongst other surgeons,
they had sent for Abernethy. When he got to the house, he
found, he says, "a poor wee man, lying on his mattress, with a
very complete compound dislocation of the ankle-joint. The
joint was completely exposed, and the torn skin was overlapping
the edge of the bone." He placed the parts in their natural
position, and drew the skin out of the rent; and when he had
thus adjusted it, as he said, a horrible accident looked as if there
had been very little the matter. "Do you think, sir," said the
poor little man, "that this can ever get well?" "Yes, verily,"
said Abernethy. "Do not be out of heart about it; I have known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
many such cases do well." "Why, sir," said the man, "they
have gone for the instruments." "I now found," said Abernethy,
"that two other surgeons had seen him, and had determined
that it was necessary to amputate. I felt that I had got
into an embarrassing predicament, and was obliged to wait until
these heroes returned. When they arrived, and saw the man
lying so comfortably, they seemed a little staggered: but one
of them said, 'Mr. Abernethy, you know the serious nature of
these accidents, and can you give us an assurance that this
will do well?' I said, 'no, certainly not; but if it does not
do well, you can have recourse to amputation afterwards, and
my surgical character is pledged no further than this. I give
you the assurance that no immediate mischief will come on to
endanger the man's life. You may wait and see whether his
constitution will allow him to do well.' I added: 'I feel that
I am got rather into a scrape; so you must allow me to manage
it in my own way.' So I got splints, put up the limb,
varnished the plaister, and then told them about sponging it
continually, so as never to allow any increase of temperature.
Now there are two holds you have on a patient's mind&mdash;hope
and fear; and I make use of both. So I said, 'If you lie
perfectly still, you will do well; and if you move one jot, you
will do ill&mdash;that's all.'" The remainder of the case need not be
given. The man recovered, and saved his limb.</p>

<p>We have referred to that case because, though relating to a
professional matter, there is a moral in it. He might easily have
saved himself all the trouble he took, and on the plea of etiquette;
but the poverty of the man pleaded for his limb, and the impossibility
in such a case, of the imputation of any wrong motive, left
free exercise for the prevailing feature of Abernethy's character&mdash;benevolence.
The mention of the instruments secured to the poor
man that <i>personal</i> attention to details by Abernethy himself which
a more wealthy patient might not have so certainly obtained.</p>

<p>We have remarked before on his kindness to hospital patients;
and sometimes the expression of their gratitude would be very
touching. It is difficult or impossible to carry out Mr. Abernethy's
principles of practice with <i>perfect</i> efficiency in the atmosphere of
a large hospital in a crowded city, yet the truth of his views would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
sometimes be impressed by very extraordinary and unexpected
results. We select the following as an example, for reasons
which will be suggested by the narrative. We are indebted to
Mr. Wood<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor"><sup>70</sup></a>, of Rochdale, for the illustration; and, as we should
only mar the scene by any abbreviation, we must allow him to tell
it in his own manner:</p>

<p>"It was on his first going through the wards after a visit to
Bath, that, passing up between the rows of beds, with an immense
crowd of pupils after him&mdash;myself among the rest&mdash;that
the apparition of a poor Irishman, with the scantiest shirt I
ever saw, jumping out of bed, and literally throwing himself on
his knees at Abernethy's feet, presented itself. For some
moments, everybody was bewildered; but the poor fellow, with
all his country's eloquence, poured out such a torrent of thanks,
prayers, and blessings, and made such pantomimic displays of
his leg, that we were not long left in doubt. 'That's the leg,
yer honnor! Glory be to God! Yer honnor's the boy to do
it! May the heavens be your bed! Long life to your
honnor! To the divole with the spalpeens that said your
honnor would cut it off!' &amp;c. The man had come into the
hospital about three months before, with a diseased ankle, and
it had been at once condemned to amputation. Something,
however, induced Abernethy to try what <i>rest</i> and constitutional
treatment would do for it, and with the happiest result.</p>

<p>"With some difficulty the patient was got into bed, and
Abernethy took the opportunity of giving us a clinical lecture
about diseases and their constitutional treatment. And now
commenced the fun. Every sentence Abernethy uttered, Pat
confirmed. 'Thrue, yer honnor, divole a lie in it. His honnor's
'the grate dochter entirely!' While, at the slightest allusion
to his case, off went the bed clothes, and up went his leg, as if he
were taking aim at the ceiling with it. 'That's it, by gorra!
and a bitther leg than the villin's that wanted to cut it off.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
This was soon after I went to London, and I was much struck
with Abernethy's manner; in the midst of the laughter, stooping
down to the patient, he said with much earnestness: 'I am
glad your leg is doing well; but never kneel, except to your
Maker.'"</p>

<p>The following letter, though containing nothing extraordinary,
still shows his usual manner of addressing a patient by letter:</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="sigleft in0">"Sir,</p>

<p>"In reply to your letter, I can only say what I must have
said to you in part, when you did me the honour of consulting
me.</p>

<p>"Firstly. That the restoration of the digestive organs to a
tranquil and healthy state, greatly depends on the strict observance
of rational rules of diet. My opinions on this subject,
which are too long to be transcribed, are to be met with at
page 72, of the first part of 'Abernethy's Surgical Observations,'
published by Longman and Co., of Paternoster Row.</p>

<p>"Secondly. Upon keeping the bowels clear, yet without
irritating them by over-doses of aperient medicine.</p>

<p>"Thirdly. I consider the blue pill as a probilious medicine,
and only urge that the dose be such as to do no harm, if it fail
to do good, and then to be taken perseveringly for some time,
in order to determine whether it will not slowly effect the object
for which it was given. In gouty habits, carbonate of soda,
&amp;c., may be given, to neutralize acidity in the stomach, with
light bitters; but the <i>prescription of medicines of this kind</i>,
as also any advice relative to the cold bath, must rest with your
medical attendant."</p>

<p>Dated the 17th of September; as usual, with him, without
the year, which was about 1824.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>It is obvious that very few professional letters are adapted for
introduction. This was one kindly sent us by Mr. Preston, of
Norwich, and was written to a gentleman in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Few things were more pleasing or valuable in Abernethy,
than his modesty and his sense of justice. He knew his superiority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
well enough, but he measured it&mdash;as Science shows us all
should do&mdash;with reference to what was still beyond him, and not
by the standard afforded by the knowledge of others. His sense
of justice was, we think, never appealed to in vain. The following
letter has appeared to us significant in relation to these
points. Amid the peaceful glories of a useful profession, there
is nothing that sinks deeper or interests our regard more, than
a man, in the hour of success, remembering what is due to others.
We think this remark particularly applicable to the late Mr. Tait,
in the following case. The letter from Abernethy was obligingly
sent us by Mr. Tait's son and successor. The remarks with
which Mr. Tait concludes his case, are as creditable to the writer
as to him whom they were intended to honour.</p>

<p>We have stated that Mr. Abernethy had been the first to extend
the application of John Hunter's celebrated operation for
the cure of aneurism, to a vessel nearer the heart (the external
iliac artery), on which Mr. Abernethy placed a ligature in 1797.
Mr. Tait, of Paisley, had an extraordinary case of aneurism in
both lower extremities, so high up as to oblige him to place a
ligature on the external iliac artery on both sides of the body.
The case occurred in an old dragoon, and the two operations were
performed at separate times, with great judgment and with complete
success. The case of course made some noise, and was highly
creditable<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor"><sup>71</sup></a>. In closing his account of the patient, Mr. Tait
observes: "The complete success which has attended these
operations, while, certainly, it affords me one of the highest
gratifications the practice of my profession can procure me,
chiefly affects Mr. Abernethy.</p>

<p>"Accident has placed under my care a case which, so far as
I know, is unparalleled in the history of surgery, and it has
been cured; but I have only put in practice what every surgeon
of the day ought to have done. When, thirty years ago, Mr.
Abernethy formed the firm resolve of cutting open the walls of
the abdomen and seizing the external iliac artery, he made a
mighty step in advance, he formed an epoch in the history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
his profession. John Hunter, upon reflecting on the hæmorrhage
proceeding from the vessel below the sac, after an operation
in 1779, when Mr. Broomfield, 'for security,' had tied the
artery three or four inches above the aneurism, had probably
the first glimpse at his great improvement of tying the artery,
in cases of aneurism, nearer the heart. His eminent successor
has extended the principles of the illustrious Hunter.</p>

<p>"So firmly impressed was Mr. Abernethy with the certainty
of ultimate success, that, nothing daunted by the unfortunate
issue of his two first cases, he persevered, and at length successfully
secured the external iliac artery. His steps have been
followed by a host, till at length it needed but such a case as
mine to add the finishing touch to his well-earned fame. In
doing justice to the merits of such men, we act but the part of
prudence; since, if we do not, indignant posterity will.</p>

<p>"Paisley, January, 1826."</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>The following is Abernethy's reply to a communication from
Mr. Tait on the subject, and couched in a tone, just in relation to
Mr. Hunter, modest and characteristic as regards himself.</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="center in0">"TO DAVID TAIT, ESQ.<br />
<span class="vspace">&#8195;</span><br />
"SURGEON, PAISLEY.</p>

<p class="sigleft in0">"Dear Sir,</p>

<p>"I have read your interesting case in the 'Edinburgh

only to thank you for the honourable mention you have made

<p>The following portion of a note, necessarily mutilated by the
suppression of professional matter, we copy as a written evidence
of his not <i>in any way</i> appearing to alter or add to a treatment
which he approved. It is written to a highly esteemed member
of our profession, Mr. Beaman, of King Street, Covent Garden.
Mr. Beaman had sent a patient alone to Mr. Abernethy, who,
having seen him, gave him the following note:</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="sigleft in0">"My dear Sir,</p>

<p>"The patient says"&mdash;here the symptoms referring to the

<p>The following letter to Mr. Wood, of Rochdale, reiterates his
opinion on a very important disease, contraction of the gullet
or œsophagus, and conveys a practical truth, which, if we may
judge from the cases published in the periodicals, is just as
necessary as ever. We allude to the too officious use of instruments
in this affection, a lesson of Abernethy's, of the practical excellence
of which Mr. Wood had convinced himself by his own experience,
as we ourselves have on many occasions.</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="sigleft in0">"My dear Sir,</p>

<p>"I think as you do with regard to the difficulty of swallowing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
It seems likely to be the effect of irritability of the
stomach; and if so, the <i>passing of instruments, however soft
and well-directed they may be</i>, is not likely to be beneficial.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I have seen so little good from such measures, that
I should feel reluctant to employ them until impelled by
stronger necessity than exists in the present case. Spasmodic
affection in the part is, as you know, exceedingly common, and
<i>continues</i> for a great many years without producing permanent
contraction. With respect to the main object of the treatment
of this case, I cannot say more than you are already acquainted
with, and which is suggested at page 72.</p>

<p>"I have of late been personally convinced of the benefit of
the strictest attention to diet. Last summer, my stomach was so
disordered that it would not digest any thing, and I was constantly
tormented by the chemical changes which the food
underwent in that organ. I had scarcely any flesh on my
bones, and sometimes every ten minutes was seized with rheumatic
spasms, which were as general and severe as those of
tetanus<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor"><sup>73</sup></a>. I went into the country, where I could get good
milk and eggs, and lived upon three ounces of baked custard
taken three times a day, drinking, four hours after each meal,
some boiled water that had been poured upon a small quantity
of ginger. Upon this quantity of food I regained my flesh,
and uniformly got better as long as I continued this plan of
diet, which was but for one month, for then I returned to
town. From the very first day, I had no more of these spasms.
As for medical treatment, I repeat that I cannot say more than
you already know. It gives me pleasure to find that you are
settled to your satisfaction.</p>

<p>"I will not be offended by a few blemishes, the result of inattention, or
against which human frailty has not sufficiently guarded."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Mankind have long established, by universal consent, the
great importance of "Manner." It has been so ably and so variously
discussed by different writers, that it is next to impossible
to say any thing new on the subject, or what has not been even
better said on the subject already. Still it is equally true that it
is a thing very much less cultivated than its influence demands;
so that really easy, good manners continue to be a very rare and
enviable possession. But if manner be thus influential in the
ordinary intercourse of life, it is still more important in ministering
to disease. People, when they are ill, have, for the wisest
purposes, their susceptibilities more vivid; and it is happy for
them when those in health have their sympathies&mdash;as is natural,
we think, that they should be&mdash;quickened in proportion. No
doubt it is a great subtraction from whatever benefit the most
skilful can confer, if it be administered in a dry, cold, unfeeling,
or otherwise repulsive manner. There is too a very sound <i>physiological</i>
as well as <i>moral</i> reason for kindness. It is difficult to
overrate the value of that calm which is sometimes diffused over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
the whole system by the impression that there is an unaffected
sympathy in our sufferings. We have of course, in our time, observed
abundant varieties of manner in our professional brethren;
and we have often listened with interest to conversations in society,
in which the manners of various medical men have been the subject
of discussion, from which good listeners might, we think,
have often taken valuable lessons.</p>

<p>We are convinced that the disguise, worn by some, of an artificial
manner, leaves, on many occasions, no one more deceived
than the wearer. Many patients have their perceptions remarkably
quickened by indisposition, and will penetrate the thin veil
of any form of affectation much more readily than people imagine.
In common language, good feeling and kind manner are said to
spring from the heart. If a man feels kindly, he will rarely express
himself otherwise, except under some momentary impulse of
impatience or indisposition.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the secret of a kind and conciliatory
manner consists in the regulation of the feelings, and in carrying
into the most ordinary affairs of life that principle which we acknowledge
as indispensable in serious matters&mdash;of doing to others
as we would they should do to us.</p>

<p>We are not speaking of a <i>polished</i> manner; that is another
affair. A man's manner to a patient may be unpolished, or as
homely as you please; but if he really feels a sympathy for his
patient, it will, with the exception to be stated, never be coarse or
unkind.</p>

<p>Some men are absurdly pompous; others, hard and cold;
some put on a drawling, maudlin tone, which the most superficial
observer detects as being affected. An honest sympathy is more
acceptable than even a polished manner; though doubtless that is
a very desirable grace to a learned profession.</p>

<p>In general, our own experience&mdash;and we know something of
indisposition in our own person&mdash;has induced us to judge favourably
of the manner of medical men.</p>

<p>There are, no doubt, exceptions, and sometimes in men in
whom you would least expect it. We have known men "eye" a
patient, as if looking at some minute object; some, jocosely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
familiar. One man has an absurd gravity; another thinks he
must be all smiles. We have known, too, the adoption of a tone
characterized by a sort of religious solemnity. These, when assumed,
are generally detected, and of course always vulgar. Some even
say really rude and unfeeling things, before any thing has happened
to provoke them. We attended a gentleman who had a
great deal of dry humour, and who was very amusing on such
matters. One morning, he said, "I saw Dr. &mdash;&mdash; on one occasion,
and the first thing he said to me I thought he might as
well have omitted. 'I see, sir,' said he, 'that you have taken
the shine out of your constitution.'"</p>

<p>Abernethy's manner was at times&mdash;always, in serious cases,
and, so far as we ever observed, to hospital patients&mdash;invariably,
as unaffectedly, kind as could be desired. It is too true that, on
many occasions of minor import, that impulsiveness of character
which we have seen in the boy, was still uncontrolled in the man,
and led him to say things which, however we may palliate, we
shall not attempt to excuse.</p>

<p>It is true his roughness was very superficial; it was the
easiest thing in the world to develop the real kindness of heart
which constantly lay beneath it; and it is very instructive to observe
how a <i>very little yielding</i> to an infirmity may occasionally
obscure one of the most benevolent hearts that ever beat in a
human breast, with the repulsive exterior of ungentle manners.
Still, patients could not be expected to know this; and therefore
too many went away dissatisfied, if not disgusted.</p>

<p>The slightest reaction was, in general, sufficient to bring him
to his self-possession. A lady, whom he had seen on former
occasions, was one day exceedingly hurt by his manner, and burst
into tears. He immediately became as kind and patient as possible,
and the lady came away just as pleased as she had been at
first offended.</p>

<p>Reaction of a different kind would answer equally well. One
day, a gentleman consulted him on a painful affection of his
shoulder, which had been of a very excruciating character. Before
he had time to enter on his case, Abernethy said, "Well, I know
nothing about it." The gentleman sharply retorted: "I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
not know how you should; but if you will have patience till I
tell you, perhaps you then may." Abernethy at once said,
"Sit down;" and heard him out, with the greatest kindness and
patience.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Thomas Chevasse, Esq. of Sutton Coldfield,
Warwick, for the following letter to a patient in Surrey, who had
complained that he did not receive any sympathy from him.</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="sigleft in0">"Dear Sir,</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have said any thing that has offended you.
I may have felt annoyed that I could not suggest any plan of
treatment more directly curative of your malady, and expressed
myself pettishly when you did not seem to understand my meaning;
for I am a fellow-sufferer, and had tried what are considered
to be appropriate remedies, unavailingly. I assure you
that I did not mean to hurt your feelings, and that I earnestly
hope the state of your health will gradually improve, and that
your local maladies will decline in proportion.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>A surgeon was requested to visit a patient in one of the suburbs
of the metropolis. When he arrived there, he had to mount
two or three dilapidated steps, and to read a number which had
been so nearly worn away, that he was enabled to determine whether
it was the number he sought only by the more legible condition
of its two neighbours. Having applied a very loose, dilapidated
knocker, an old woman came to the door.</p>

<p>"Does Captain &mdash;&mdash; live here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Is he at home?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Please, sir, may I be so bold&mdash;are you the doctor,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh! then, sir, please to walk up."</p>

<p>The surgeon went up a small, narrow staircase, into a moderate-size,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
dirty, ill-furnished room, the walls of which were
coloured something between yellow and red, with a black border.
An old man, in a very shabby and variegated <i>deshabille</i>, rose from
his chair, and, with a grace worthy of a court, welcomed the
stranger. His manner was extremely gentlemanly, his language
well chosen, the statement of his complaint particularly simple
and clear. The surgeon, who, like most of us, sees strange things,
was puzzled to make out his new patient; but concluded he was
one of the many who, having been born to better things, had
been reduced by some misfortune to narrow circumstances. Everything
seemed to suggest that construction, and to warrant no
other. Accordingly, having prescribed, the surgeon was about
to take his leave, when the old gentleman said:</p>

<p>"Sir, I thank you very much for your attention;" at the
same time offering his hand with a fee.</p>

<p>This the surgeon declined, simply saying:</p>

<p>"No, I thank you, sir. I hope you will soon be better.
Good morning."</p>

<p>"Stay, sir," said the old gentleman; "I shall insist on this,
if you please;" in a tone which at once made the surgeon feel
that it would be painful and improper to refuse. He accordingly
took it. The old gentleman then said, "I am very much obliged
to you, sir; for had you not taken your fee, I could not again
have the advantage of your advice. I sent for you because I
had understood that you were a pupil of Mr. Abernethy's, for
whom I could not send again, because he would not take his
fee; and I was so hurt, that I am afraid I was almost rude to
him. I suppose, judging from the appearance of things here
that I could not afford it, he refused his fee; on which I begged
him not to be deceived by appearances, but to take it. However,
he kept retreating and declining it, until, forgetting myself
a little, and feeling somewhat vexed, I said, 'By G&mdash;, sir, I
insist on your taking it!' when he replied, 'By G&mdash;, sir, I
will not!' and, hastily leaving the room, closed the door after
him."</p>

<p>This gentleman has been dead some years. He lived to a
very advanced age&mdash;nearly, if not quite, ninety&mdash;and had many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
instructive points of character. He was really in very good circumstances;
but he lived in a very humble manner, to enable him
to assist very efficiently some poor relations. To do this, he saved
all that he could; and although he insisted on the surgeon taking
a fee when he visited him, he said that he should not hesitate to
accept his kindness when he called on the surgeon. The intercourse
continued many years; but with rather a curious result.</p>

<p>After a time, growing infirmities converted what had been a
visit&mdash;perhaps once or twice a year&mdash;into occasional attendances,
when the rule he had prescribed to himself, of paying visits at
home, became characterized by very numerous exceptions; and, at
last, by so many, that the rule and the exception changed places.
The surgeon, however, went on, thinking that the patient could
not do other without disturbing existing arrangements. When,
however, the old gentleman died, about four hundred guineas were
found in his boxes, wrapped up, and in various sums, strongly
suggestive of their having been (under the influence of a propensity
too common in advancing life) savings, from the somewhat
unnecessary forbearance of his medical attendant. We know one
other very similar occurrence.</p>

<p>Sometimes Mr. Abernethy would meet with a patient who
would afford a useful lesson. A lady, the wife of a very distinguished
musician, consulted him, and, finding him uncourteous,
said, "I had heard of your rudeness before I came, sir; but I
did not expect this." When Abernethy gave her the prescription,
she said, "What am I to do with this?"</p>

<p>"Anything you like. Put it in the fire, if you please."</p>

<p>The lady took him at his word&mdash;laid his fee on the table, and
threw the prescription into the fire, and hastily left the room.
Abernethy followed her into the hall, pressing her to take back
her fee, or to let him give her another prescription; but the lady
was inexorable, and left the house.</p>

<p>The foregoing is well-authenticated. Mr. Stowe knows the
lady well, who is still living. But many of these stories, to our
own knowledge, were greatly exaggerated. Abernethy would
sometimes offend, not so much by the manner as by the matter;
by saying what were very salutary, but very unpleasant truths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
and of which the patient perhaps felt only the sting. We know
a gentleman, an old fox-hunter, who abused Abernethy roundly;
but all he could say against him was: "Why, sir, almost the
moment I entered the room, he said: 'I perceive you drink a
good deal,'" which was very true. "Now," added the patient,
very <i>naïvely</i>, "suppose I did, what the devil was that to him!"</p>

<p>Another gentleman, of considerable literary reputation, but
who, as regarded drinking, was not intemperate, had a most unfortunate
appearance on his nose, exactly like that which frequently
accompanies dram-drinking. This gentleman used to be exceedingly
irate against Abernethy, although all I could gather from him
amounted to nothing more than this, that when he said his
stomach was out of order, Abernethy observed, "Ay, I see that
by your nose," or some equivalent expression.</p>

<p>However rough Abernethy could occasionally be, there was,
on grave occasions, no feature of his character more striking than
his humanity. Dr. Barnett<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor"><sup>74</sup></a> had a case where Abernethy was
about to perform a severe operation. The Doctor, at that time a
young man, was anxious to have every thing duly prepared, and
had been very careful. When Abernethy arrived, he went into
the room into which the patient was to be brought, and, looking on
the instruments, &amp;c. on the table, said: "Ay, yes, that is all
right;" then, pausing for a moment, he said: "No, there is
one thing you have forgotten;" and then, throwing a napkin
over the instruments, added: "It is bad enough for the poor
patient to have to undergo an operation, without being obliged
to see those terrible instruments."</p>

<p>Few people get off so badly in the world as poor gentlemen.
There are multifarious provisions in this kingdom for all sorts of
claimants; but a poor gentleman slips down between those which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
are not applicable to his case, and those which are too repulsive
to be practicable. His sensibilities remain&mdash;nay, perhaps are
sharpened&mdash;and thus, whilst they tend to exasperate his wants,
they increase the difficulty of supplying them. There is here
afforded a grateful opportunity for the indulgence of what we
believe, amidst some exceptions, to be the ruling spirit of medical
men: a sensitive philanthropy, which no men in the world are
more liberal in disbursing. Abernethy had his full share of this
excellence. There are multitudes of instances exemplifying it.
We are indebted for the following to Mr. Brown, of the
respected firm of Longman and Co. Abernethy was just stepping
into his carriage to go and see the Duke of &mdash;&mdash;, to whom
he had been sent for in a hurry, when a gentleman stopped him
to say that he should be very glad if he could, at his leisure, pay
Mr. &mdash;&mdash; another visit at Somers Town. Abernethy had seen
this poor gentleman before, and advised a course which it appeared
that the patient had not resolution to follow. "Why,"
said Abernethy, "I can't go now, I am going in haste to see the
Duke of &mdash;&mdash;." Then pausing a moment before he stepped
into the carriage, he looked up to the coachman and said, quietly,
"Somers Town." This is very characteristic. The fidgetty
irritability of his first impression at interference, and the beneficence
of his second thought.</p>

<p>Dr. Thomas Rees knew a gentleman who was a man of ability,
who had been a long time ill, and who got a scanty living by his
writings. Dr. Rees called on Abernethy, one morning, and told
him that the gentleman wished to have his opinion; but that he
had heard such accounts of him, he was half afraid to see him.
"And if he were not," said Dr. Rees, "he is not able to pay
you. He is a great sufferer, and he gets his living by working
his brains." "Ah!" said Abernethy; "where does he live,
do you say?" "At &mdash;&mdash;," mentioning a place full two
miles distant. Abernethy immediately rang the bell, ordered his
carriage, visited the gentleman, and was most kind to him.</p>

<p>One day, a pupil wished to consult him, and found him, about
ten minutes before lecture, in the museum, looking over his preparations
for lecture&mdash;rather a dangerous time, we should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
said, for consultation. "I am afraid, sir," said the pupil, "that
I have a polypus in my nose, and I want you to look at it."
No answer; but when he had sorted his preparations, he said:
"Eh! what?" The pupil repeated his request. "Then stand
upon your head; don't you see that all the light here comes
from a skylight? How am I to look up your nose? Where
do you live?" "Bartholomew Close." "What time do you
get up?" "At eight." "That can't be then." "Why,
sir?" "You cannot be at Bedford Row at nine." "Yes,
sir, I will." "To-morrow morning, then." The pupil was
punctual. Mr. Abernethy made a most careful examination of
his nose, entered into the causes and nature of polypi, assured
him that there was nothing of the sort, and exacted from him a
promise that he would never look into his nose again. The gentleman,
in his letter to me, adds: "This I have never done, and
I am happy to say that there has never been any thing the
matter."</p>

<p>The following we have from a source of unquestionable
authority:</p>

<p>Abernethy was attending a poor man, whose case required
assistance at a given time of the day. One morning, when he
was to see this patient, the Duke of York called to say that the
Prince of Wales wished him to visit him immediately. "That I
cannot do," said Mr. Abernethy, "as I have an appointment
at twelve o'clock"&mdash;the time he promised to visit the poor
man. "But," said the Duke, "you will not refuse the Prince;
if so, I must proceed to &mdash;&mdash;." "Ah!" said Abernethy,
"he will suit the Prince better than I should." He was, however,
again sent for, a few hours later, when he of course
visited the Prince.</p>

<p>Very many instances of his liberality were constantly occurring.
The following is a specimen:</p>

<p>The widow of an officer of limited income brought her child
some distance from the country to consult Abernethy. After a
few weeks' attendance, the lady having asked Abernethy when
she might return home, was told that she must remain some
weeks longer, or he could not answer for the well-doing of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
case. In the meantime, having learned how the widow was
situated, he continued to take the fees, folding them up in a
paper. When he finally took his leave, he returned home,
enclosed the fees which he had received, with the addition of a
cheque for £50, with a kind note, saying, that as he understood
her income was limited, he had returned the fees, with an addition,
which would enable her to give the child, who could not
walk, a daily ride in the fresh air, which was important to her
recovery.</p>

<p>He was, indeed, as it appeared to us, most liberal in the
mode of conducting his practice. When asked by a patient
when he desired to see them again, it was at the longest period
compatible with a reasonable observation of the case; and we
doubt whether he ever took a fee where he had even a <i>doubt</i> as to
the circumstances of the patient justifying his so doing. It
would be easy to multiply examples of this; but it would be a
constructive injustice to others to appear to bring things out
in high relief, or as <i>special</i> excellences, which (notwithstanding
some exceptions) from our hearts we believe to be a prevailing
characteristic of the profession.</p>

<p>Abernethy had been, nearly all his life, without being improvident,
habitually careless of money; and, although he provided his
family with a comfortable competency, which very properly left
their position unaltered by his death, yet we doubt if ever any
man, with the opportunity of making so much, availed himself of
that opportunity so little.</p>

<p>Many instances occurred of his carelessness in these matters.</p>

<p>He used to put his not very slowly accumulating fees anywhere;
sometimes by the side of his portfolio; sometimes on a
shelf in his bookcase, between something else which might be
there. When he retired from Bedford Row, they found a considerable
heap of fees which he had placed in the bookcase and
forgotten&mdash;an anecdote which shows that he must have been
making some way in practice as early as his marriage, exemplifies
this sort of carelessness, and suggests its impropriety. He was in
the habit, even then, of leaving his fees on his table in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
private room. He thought, on more than one occasion, that
some had been removed: he, however, said nothing; but, having
taken means to assure himself of the fact, he marked some fees
and allowed matters to go on as usual. Again missing fees, he
waited till the whole party, which consisted of pupils residing in
the house, were settled at breakfast. "Gentlemen," he said, "I
must beg you to give me your purses." This was of course
immediately done. In one of the purses he found the marked
fees. This individual has been dead many years. He turned
out, as may be supposed, <i>badly</i>.</p>

<p>It had become the fashion in Abernethy's latter days to speak
lightly of him as an operator; and we have very little desire to
rest any portion of his reputation on this branch of our duty.
Nevertheless, when we first knew Abernethy, if we had had to be
the subject of an operation, we knew no man to whom we should
have submitted with the same confidence. He was considerate
and humane; he did as he would be done by; and we have seen
him perform those operations which are usually regarded as the
most difficult, as well as we have seen them ever performed by
any body; and without any of that display or effect too often
observed, which is equally misplaced and disgusting.</p>

<p>His benevolent disposition led him to feel a great deal in
regard to operations. Like Cheselden and Hunter, he regarded
them, as in a scientific sense they truly are, the reproach of the
profession; since, with the exception of such as become necessary
from accidents, they are almost all of them consequent on the
imperfection of Medicine or Surgery as a science.</p>

<p>Highly impulsive, Abernethy could not at all times prevent
the expression of his feelings, when perhaps his humanity was
most earnestly engaged in his suppression of them. It was
usually an additional trial to him when a patient bore pain with
fortitude.</p>

<p>One day, he was performing rather a severe operation on a
woman. He had, before commencing, said a few words of
encouragement, as was usual with him, and the patient was bearing
the operation with great fortitude. After suffering some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
seconds, she very earnestly, but firmly, said, "I hope, sir, it will
not be long." "No, indeed," earnestly replied Abernethy;
"that would indeed be horrible."</p>

<p>In fact, he held operations as occupying altogether so low a
place in our duties, and as having so little to do with the science
of our profession, that there was very little in most of them to
set against that repulsion which both his science and his humanity
suggested.</p>

<p>As he advanced in life, his dislike to operations increased.
He was apt to be fidgetty and impatient. If things went smoothly,
it was all very well; but if any untoward occurrence took place,
he suffered a great deal, and it became unpleasant to assist him;
but he was never unkind to the patient. It is, however, not
always easy to estimate correctly the amount of operative dexterity.
Hardly any man will perform a dozen operations in the same
manner. We have seen a very bungling operator occasionally
perform an operation extremely well; whilst the very worst operation
we ever saw was performed by a man whose fame rested
almost entirely on his dexterity; and what made it the more
startling, was that it was nothing more than taking up the
femoral artery. But whether it were that he was not well, or had
been careless <i>in the site</i> of his first incision, or in <i>opening the
sheath</i> of the vessels before he passed his ligature, or all of these
causes in conjunction, we could not tell, because we were not
quite near enough; but we never witnessed a more clumsy affair.</p>

<p>The conditions calculated to ensure good operating, are few
and simple; there are <i>moral</i> as well as medical conditions; and
no familiarity ever enables a surgeon, on any occasion, <i>safely</i> to
dispense with any of them. When they <i>are all</i> observed, operating
usually becomes steady and uniform; when <i>any</i> of them are
dispensed with or wanting, there is always risk of error and confusion.</p>

<p>We are afraid that we should be hardly excused in a work of
this kind, were we to lay down the canons to which we allude.
We cannot, therefore, enter any further into the subject.</p>

<p>Previously to offering a few remarks on the causes of Abernethy's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
occasional irritability, we must not omit to mention a
hoax that was played on him. He had been in particularly good,
boy-like spirits, and had proposed going to the theatre; where he
had enjoyed himself very much. On reaching home, there was a
message desiring his attendance at Harrow. This was a very
unwelcome finale. The hoax had been clumsily managed, but it
did not strike anybody at the moment; so it was decided that
Mr. Abernethy must go; and he took Mr. Skey with him.
When they got to Harrow, they drove to the house of the
surgeon, and, knocking him up, the surgeon came to the window
in his night-cap, when the following dialogue began. The name
of the patient we shall suppose to be Wilson.</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Wilson live here?"</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I say, then, is Mr. Wilson living here?"</p>

<p>"I say what do you want? Who the d&mdash;&mdash;l are you?"</p>

<p>"I say that I want to find a Mr. Wilson; and my name is
Abernethy."</p>

<p>"Immediately," says Mr. Skey, "off flew the night-cap."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Mr. Abernethy; what can I do for
you," &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Is there a Mr. Wilson living here; and has he broken his
leg?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, he is living here; but he is very well, and has
not met with anything of the kind."</p>

<p>Abernethy laughed heartily, and ordered the post-boy to drive
him home again.</p>

<p>There would be no difficulty in multiplying anecdotes given
to Abernethy; but there are some objections to such a course.
In the first place, there are many told of him which never
happened; others, which may probably have happened, you find
it impossible to authenticate; and, lastly, there is a third class,
which, if they happened to Abernethy, certainly happened to others
before Abernethy was born. In fact, when a man once gets a
reputation of doing or saying odd things, every story in which
the chief person is unknown or unremembered is given to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
man whose reputation in this way is most remarkable. We
need not say how impossible it is, in a Memoir of this kind, to
introduce, with propriety, matters thus apocryphal.</p>

<p>We have no doubt that, with a most benevolent disposition,
Abernethy's manner, particularly as he advanced in years, evinced
great irritability; and we believe that it was the result of two
or three different causes, which, in their combined influence, got
a mastery which the utmost resolution was not at all times able
to control. It had formed the subject of numerous conversations
between Abernethy and some of his most intimate friends, and
we believe had arisen, and been unconsciously fostered by the
following causes: "In early life, he had been," as he told Dr.
Thomas Rees, "particularly disgusted with the manner in which
he had seen patients caressed and 'humbugged' by smooth and
flattering modes of proceeding, and that he had early resolved
to 'avoid that at all events.'" He further observed: "I tried
to learn my profession, and thinking I could teach it, I educated
myself to do so; but as for private practice, of course I am
<i>obliged</i> to do that too." We can easily understand how, in a
sensitive mind, an anxiety to avoid an imputation of one kind
might have led to an opposite extreme; and thus an occasional
negligence of ordinary courtesy have taken the place of a disgusting
assentation.</p>

<p>A temper naturally impulsive, would find in the perplexities
which sometimes beset the practice of our profession, too many
occasions on which the suggestions of ruffled temper, and of fear
of improper assentation, would unfortunately coincide; and thus
tend to intermix and confound the observance of a praiseworthy
caution, with a yielding to an insidious habit. If to this were
now added that increase of irritability which a disturbed and
fidgetty state of physique never fails to furnish, and from which
Abernethy <i>greatly suffered</i>, the habit would soon become dominant;
and thus an originally good motive, left unguarded, be
supplanted by an uncontrolled impulse. We believe this to have
been the short explanation of Abernethy's manner; all we know
of him seems to admit of this explanation. It was a habit, and
required nothing but a check from his humanity or his good sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
to correct it; but then this was just that which patients were not
likely to know, and could have been still less expected to elicit.</p>

<p>Again, most men so celebrated are sure to be more or less
spoiled. They become themselves insensibly influenced by that
assentation which, when detected, they sincerely despised. The
moral seems to be, that the impulses of the most benevolent heart
may be obscured or frustrated by an irritable temper; that habits the
most faulty may rise from motives which, in their origin, were
pure or praiseworthy; that it is the character of Vice to tempt us
by small beginnings; that, knowing her own deformity, she
seldom fails to recommend herself as the representative, and too
often to assume the garb, of Virtue; that the most just and
benevolent are not safe, unless habitual self-government preside
over the dictates of the intellect and the heart, and that the
<i>impulse</i> to which <i>assent</i> is yielded to-day, may exert the influence
of a command to-morrow; that, in fact, we must be masters or
slaves.</p>

<p>The views which we have thus ventured on submitting, are
verbatim those which appeared in the former editions of these
Memoirs, and, consequently, were written long before we were
favoured with the following letter. It was written to his daughter
Anne, before her marriage with the late Dr. Warburton, dated
Littlehampton, August 13, and is remarkably corroborative of
some of the preceding remarks.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"My dear Anne,</p>

<p>"Lack of employment is, as I believe, the cause of your
receiving this note in reply to the one I received from you by
your mother. Certain I am that I never thought of writing an
answer till just now, when it occurred to me that it would be
polite to do so, which very phrase had nearly prevented the
intention. Why have all the legitimate children of John
Bull an aversion to politeness? 'Tis because it so commonly
covereth a multitude of sins; because, with honest simplicity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
they have often caught hold of the garb and found that it concealed
deformity and malice. I frankly acknowledge that I may
have carried my detestation too far, because it does not necessarily
follow that our best friends should not wear becoming and
fashionable apparel. I like to see them <i>en deshabille</i>, however.
'Tis the man, and not the dress, I am concerned about. I tell you,
sincerely, that I take your note to be one of many evidences of
your having both a good head and heart. Other young ladies
would have spoken to mamma. Enough of this unprofitable chat.</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>When the editors of the medical periodicals first began to
publish the lectures given at the different hospitals, there was
considerable discussion as to the propriety of so doing. The
press, of course, defended its own views in a spirit which, though
not always unwelcome to readers, is frequently "wormwood" to
the parties to whom the press may be opposed.</p>

<p>We are not lawyers, and therefore have no claim to an
opinion, we suppose, on the "right;" but, as regards the general
effect of this custom <i>as now practised</i>, we are afraid (however
advantageous it may be to the trade to obtain gratuitously these
bulky contributions to their columns) that doubts may not be
unreasonably entertained whether it is of advantage to science,
to the character of our periodical literature, or the profession.</p>

<p>The publicity which it gives to a man's name, induces men to
contribute matter which it would often have been, perhaps, more
advantageous to them to have suppressed; and the proprietors,
so long as a periodical "pays," are not likely to quarrel with that
which they get for nothing but the expense of publication.</p>

<p>Mr. Abernethy was very much opposed to the publication of
his lectures; but, though not insensible by any means to the
occasionally caustic remarks of the press, he does not seem to
have been much annoyed by them.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<p>The following is an extract from a letter, in which he expresses
himself as opposed to the conduct of those who publish lectures
without the permission of the authors. We suppress that part,
because it involves his opinion of the conduct of individuals.
As regards his personal feelings, he says:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"Though I have been so long in replying to your letter, I
have felt very grateful for the kindness which induced you to
take up the cudgels in my behalf. At the same time, I must
say that, had I been at your elbow, I should have hinted to you
that the object was not worth the trouble you have been so
good as to bestow upon it. No one can expect to escape
slander and misrepresentation; and these are so commonly
bestowed upon all, that they have little or no influence on the
minds of persons of character and judgment.</p>

<p>"With many thanks and best wishes,</p>

<p class="sigright">"I remain, my dear sir,&#8195;&#8195;<br />
"Yours very sincerely,&#8195;<br />
"<span class="smcap">John Abernethy</span>."</p>

<p class="center bold in0 p2t">SECTION.</p>

<p>When Mr. Abernethy was appointed <i>surgeon</i> to St. Bartholomew's
Hospital, in 1815, he had already been twenty-eight years
assistant surgeon, and was therefore fifty years of age before he
had an opportunity of taking an active share in the practical
administration of the Hospital. This is one of the many effects
of a System of which we shall presently give a sketch. He was
thus invested with the additional duties of Surgeon of the
Hospital, and Professor to the College of Surgeons, at a time of
life when most people, who have commenced young and laboured
hard with their intellects, as distinguished from their hands, begin
to feel their work. This was the case with Abernethy. We do
not think that his original physical organization was to be complained
of; he had been active and energetic, he was of moderate
stature and well-proportioned; a magnificently poised brain, judging
phrenologically; and, in short (under favourable circumstances),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
he appeared to have had the elements of long life; but we think
that his organization&mdash;and especially the presiding power, the
nervous system&mdash;was ill-adapted either for the air, the anxieties, or
the habits of a crowded city; or the somewhat pestilential atmosphere
of a dissecting-room.</p>

<p>We saw him, therefore, ageing at fifty very sensibly, and
rather more than is in general observable at that period. He
complained, in 1817, of the fatigue of the College lectures, coming,
as they did, on the completion of a season of the "mill-round"
of hospital tuition and practice. So that, when we mentioned
the period of his lectures at the College as on so many
accounts the zenith of his career, there was the serious drawback
arising from a certain diminution of strength which had never
been, at best, equal to the <i>physical</i> fatigue of his multiform avocations.
All this arose partly out of a System, which, although,
like all evils, not allowed to proceed without being charged with
elements of remotely prospective correction, has been the parent
of much mischief. This is what we have called the "Hospital
System," some of the more important features of which we will
now present to our readers.</p>


<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_74_74" id="Footnote_74_74"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74_74">[74]</a> This gentleman, who retired some years since from practice, died at
Norwood, about a month ago, at the age of 73. Dr. Barnett was born at
Malmesbury, and was an early pupil of Abernethy's, and a friend of Dr. Jenner's;
he practised many years as a general practitioner in Charter-House Square,
where he realized, we believe, a comfortable competency. He was distinguished
by a singularly mild, gentlemanly, and inoffensive bearing, not less
than by the confidence reposed in his skill and judgment by a large list of
patients and friends.</p>

<p>If we would view any human institution dispassionately, we
must distinguish the vices of System from the faults of those who
administer it.</p>

<p>Trite as this remark may be, the caution it involves is just
that which is too frequently overlooked or unobserved. By a
careful attention to the distinction it implies, we may develop the
elements of rational reform, as contrasted with Utopian schemes;
which, whatever of abstract truth they may contain, are frequently
useless, simply because they are impracticable. We cannot effect
any material change in human nature by any summary legislation,
nor prevent the obtrusive necessities of daily life from bringing
down the soaring aspirations of mind, to the humble level of the
practicabilities of matter. Whoever, therefore, expects that any
body of men, invested with irresponsible power, will hesitate to
exercise it so as to procure, as they believe, the maximum of advantage
to themselves,&mdash;might just as hopefully quarrel with the
negro on account of his complexion. Do what you may, Man is
Man "for a' that;" but whilst it is necessary to remember this,
it is by no means so, to do it in a spirit of unkindness or hostility,
nor in any sense opposed to brotherly love; but, on the contrary,
in a tone of mind which, alike mild and uncompromising, desires
to promote universal harmony and good feeling, by removing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
temptations which experience has shown to be influential in disturbing
such relations.</p>

<p>Neither should we quarrel with a man who endeavours to do
the best he can for his family and friends. Should he, even in
this pursuit, compromise his duty to the public, it is very <i>possible</i>
that the objects which he had in view may have been in themselves
praiseworthy, and therefore, instead of exasperating our blame,
may readily <i>extenuate</i> faults which it may be impossible to
excuse.</p>

<p>The truth is, that the interests of the public and of individuals
are seldom, if ever, incompatible; the occasions on which
they appear to be so are not unfrequent; those in which they
really clash are extremely rare.</p>

<p>Wherever circumstances occur in which the temptation of a
present fruition is found habitually to lead men to courses which,
however apparently promotive of their own interests, are really
detrimental to those of the public,&mdash;it becomes very necessary
that the public should impose safeguards against such an injurious
exercise of power.</p>

<p>The hospitals of London, as we formerly observed, are, in the
main, very fine institutions. They are many of them very
wealthy, which generally means powerful also.</p>

<p>The Governors, as they are termed, consist of certain noblemen
and gentlemen; the latter being, for the most part, drawn
from the more wealthy sections of the mercantile and trading
classes.</p>

<p>The knowledge possessed by these gentlemen of the requisitions
of a large public hospital, must (special instances excepted)
be very measured; and be, in the main, derived from the
medical officers with whom they are associated.</p>

<p>It thus happens that the administration of the hospital is in
great part confided&mdash;as, with <i>some restrictions</i>, it ought to be&mdash;to
the medical officers. The interests of these gentlemen, it may
be assumed, would be best promoted by carrying out in the most
efficient manner the benevolent objects of the institution: and we
believe, looked at fairly and comprehensively, this would be really
the case. The duties of a large hospital, however&mdash;if they are to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
be performed conscientiously&mdash;require much time, not a little
labour, and some health to boot. Now all these, in a crowded
community, are very costly articles; and which must, in justice&mdash;and,
what is material, in fact too&mdash;be fairly remunerated. The
public never <i>really</i> pay so dearly, as when they <i>appear</i> to get
labour for nothing.</p>

<p>Here we come to the first defect in the "Hospital System."</p>

<p>It might be supposed that, with ample means, the Governors
of Hospitals, by adopting such previous tests as were in their
power, would have secured the most efficient officers, by paying
them remunerative salaries; and, having retained them as long as
their services were deemed efficient, or the duration of them justified,
that they would have released them from the necessity of
further exertion by a retiring pension. No such thing. The Hospital
gives nothing: actually, there is a small nominal retaining fee,
as it were, of about £60 to £100 a year, and the medical officer
is left to obtain his remuneration for time, trouble, and health,
by such private practice as his reputation or the <i>prestige</i> of being
attached to an hospital may afford; from fees from pupils, or
such other means as the position he occupies may place within
his power.</p>

<p>He very naturally sets to work to do the best he can; and
from this first budding, we very soon arrive at the full blossom of
the System; one effect of which is, that, in hospitals, which have
so large a care of public health&mdash;institutions which, whether
correctly or incorrectly, give so much of the tone to the medical
opinions of the day, which exert, either directly or indirectly, an
influence on the claims of hundreds to public confidence&mdash;that in
these hospitals there is <i>not one single surgeoncy that is fairly
and bonâ fide open to scientific competition</i>.</p>

<p>Let us now examine a little into the machinery by which these
results are brought out.</p>

<p>The experience afforded by the hospitals necessarily supplies
abundant means for instructing students in surgery. They are
accordingly admitted on paying certain fees to the surgeon; and
this at once supplies a large revenue. This revenue is of course
regulated by the number of pupils; and as there are in London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
many hospitals, so it follows that there is an active competition.
Thus, some time before the season commences, the advertisements
of the medical schools occupy a considerable space in the public
journals, and circulars are also liberally distributed.</p>

<p>Well, the points here, as in all other cases, are the advantages
offered, and the price paid&mdash;the maximum and minimum respectively.
Here we arrive at the elements of numerous evils.</p>

<p>Students are not always&mdash;and before they try, hardly ever&mdash;judges
of a school. The general reputation of a man (as he is
never subjected to open competition) is no test whatever of his
comparative power in <i>teaching</i> students; but they are accustomed
to ascribe great importance to operations; and, <i>cæteris paribus</i>,
they incline to prefer that hospital where the greatest number are
supposed to be performed.</p>

<p>This arises from various causes; in some of which the public
play no unimportant part. The student has perhaps seen, in the
country, a good deal of medical and surgical practice; but very
few operations. His stay in London is comparatively short,
averaging, perhaps, not more than the better part of two years.
Unnecessary length of time is generally inconvenient, always expensive,
and the student is naturally anxious to see <i>most</i> of that
which he will have <i>least</i> opportunity of observing elsewhere.
Moreover, he knows that when he returns to the country he may
save twenty limbs, before he obtains the same amount of <i>reputation</i>
that he may possibly get by <i>one amputation</i>&mdash;the ignorance
of the public, here, not appreciating results which very probably
involved the exercise of the highest talent, whilst they are ready
to confer a very profitable distinction on that which does not
necessarily involve any talent at all.</p>

<p>We have no wish whatever, and certainly there is no necessity,
for straining any point in reference to this very serious
matter; but these two facts are indisputable&mdash;that the surgeons
obtain their remuneration from the hospitals by the fees they obtain
from the pupils; and, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, the pupils will flock
the thickest where they expect to see most operations.</p>

<p>The next thing that we would submit, is that the <i>prestige</i> in
favour of operations is both directly and indirectly opposed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
progress of scientific surgery. Almost all operations, commonly
so termed, are examples of defective science. To practical common
sense, therefore, it would appear a very infelicitous mode of
obtaining the maximum of a man's genius in aid of the <i>diminution</i>
of operations, to open to him a prospect of enriching himself
by the <i>multiplication</i> of them. We desire to consider the
subject with reference to its scientific bearings only, and would
avoid entirely, were that possible, any appeal merely to the feelings.
Such impulses, however right, are apt to be paroxysmal and
uncertain, unless supported by the intellect. But, on such a
subject, the feelings must necessarily become more or less interested.
Wherever a system takes a wrong direction, a great many
minor evils insensibly grow out of it.</p>

<p>The erection of a theatre for the purpose of operating, though
founded on a feasible pretext, is a very questionable measure; and,
unless of clear advantage to the profession or the public, is surely
not without some character of repulsion. As regards art and
science, it is certain that not more than twenty or thirty can be
near enough in the theatre to see anything that can be really
instructive in the performance of operations. In the absence
of actual advantage, therefore, an exhibition of this kind is more
calculated to give publicity to the surgeon operating, than it is to
raise the tone or chasten the feelings of men about to enter
a profession which almost daily establishes requisitions for our
highest faculties. Operations without opportunities of real instruction,
are merely unprofitable expenditure of valuable time.
That which is viewed as a sort of <i>exhibition</i> to-day, may be with
difficulty regarded in the light of a <i>serious duty</i> to-morrow.
Were the object to tax the sensibility of a student, and blind
him to any higher association with pain and suffering than that
afforded by custom and chloroform, and to substitute for a dignified
self-possession and sympathy with suffering, which each kept the
other in due control, an indifference to everything save adroitness
of manipulation and mechanical display,&mdash;no machinery could be
better calculated to effect such objects; but science and humanity
require very different qualifications, and experience has shown that
they are neither incompatible nor beyond our power.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span></p>

<p>The humanity and science that beholds, in operative surgery, the
lowest of our employments, and which would thence be impelled
to seek, and as experience has taught us to seek successfully, to
diminish the number of such exhibitions, and to lessen the suffering
of those which are still retained, is perfectly compatible with
coolness and skill in the performance of them.</p>

<p>When we speak of lessening pain, we must not be understood
as alluding to chloroform, or agencies of that kind. We have, on
the contrary, the greatest distrust of their utility; we do not
hesitate to admit the propriety of their use in certain cases; but
we are satisfied that, as at present employed, a very few years will
make a great change. Many a so-called incurable case has been
shown to be curable by the hesitation of the patient to submit to
an operation. We have published some ourselves, wherein we
joined in recommending the measure which the patient declined.
Many deaths that we <i>do know</i> have already occurred from the use
of chloroform; and a <i>significant</i> remark was made by a man who
had considerable reputation in this way. He said: "Chloroform
is a good thing for operating surgeons."</p>

<p>To return from this digression. The most distinguished
surgeons ever known in this country have shown us how
to combine, in the highest degree, dexterity and skill, with
science and humanity; together with a just estimate of the
low position occupied by operations in the scale of our important
studies. I may allude to two more particularly,
Cheselden and John Hunter; the former, the most expert and
successful operator of his day, in the European sense of the
word, has left us a satisfactory declaration on this subject.
Cheselden acknowledges that he seldom slept much the night
previous to the day on which he had any important operation;
but that, once engaged in operating, he was always firm, and his
hand never trembled. John Hunter was not only a good operator
himself, but he deduced from observation one of the greatest
improvements in operative surgery. His discovery had all the
elements of improvement that are possible in this branch of the
profession.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span></p>

<p>An operation which had been founded upon erroneous views
of the nature and relations of the parts affected&mdash;which had been
always tedious and painful in performance&mdash;which, whether successful
or not, entailed much subsequent suffering, which in its
results was highly dangerous, and which was very commonly followed
by the loss of the limb or life,&mdash;was replaced by one
founded on more correct views of the disease, easy and simple in its
execution, occupying not more than a very few minutes, and which,
so far as regards the purpose for which it was instituted, and to
which it should be restricted, is almost invariably successful. If
it be performed under circumstances implying conditions <i>contrary
to those on which Mr. Hunter's operation was founded</i>, very different
results have no doubt taken place; but, when properly
applied, his operation for aneurism is no doubt one of the
greatest improvements in operative surgery.</p>

<p>John Hunter treats of operations in terms which show how
low he rated that part of our duties. He speaks of them as
humiliating examples of the imperfection of our science, and
figures to himself an operator under the repulsive symbol of an
armed savage. "No surgeon," said he, "should approach the
victim of his operation without a sacred dread and reluctance,
and should be <i>superior to that popular éclat generally attending
painful operations, often only because they are so</i>, or because
they are expensive to the patient"&mdash;p. 210. Abernethy, whose
keen observation saw the difficult web which various sophistries,
to use no harsher term, had thrown around the subject, was very
characteristic in the manner in which he dashed it aside, and
pointed to the salient source of error.</p>

<p>"Never perform an operation," he would say, "on another
person, which, under similar circumstances, you would not have
performed on yourself."</p>

<p>The truth is, that operations, to be performed properly, must
be properly studied. They must be frequently performed on the
dead, and afterwards carefully examined. There is a wide difference
between neglecting a necessary study and making that the
test of science which is the most emphatic proof of its imperfection.
We have ourselves had no lack of experience in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
branch of the profession, and have included not a few operations
which are too commonly delivered over to men who are said to
devote themselves to special objects. The result of our experience
satisfies us in entertaining the views which the most distinguished
men have held on this subject; whilst we are persuaded
that few things have contributed more to impede the progress of
science than the <i>abuse</i> of operations.</p>

<p>To return to the surgical appointments of the hospital.</p>

<p>The positions which had at first been left without any remuneration,
become, by the machinery described, very lucrative;
directly, by the fees paid by the pupils; and indirectly, in some
cases, by keeping the surgeon constantly before the public. Any
<i>prestige</i>, therefore, in obtaining these appointments, is of great
value; but, if that do not really involve <i>professional excellence</i>,
it is as plain as possible that the public may be very badly served,
and an evil generated equally opposed to the interests of science
and humanity. It is obvious that the only legitimate grounds of
eligibility are moral and professional superiority, as determined
by the test adopted at public schools and universities&mdash;namely,
public competition. Now, what are the tests employed? Without
meaning to insinuate that moral or professional eligibility is
<i>wholly</i> disregarded&mdash;no system in these days will support that&mdash;still
the eligibility depends on a qualification which few would
beforehand have imagined. It is certainly something better than
Mr. Macaulay's joke in relation to the proposed franchise to the
Militia&mdash;namely, that the elector should be five feet two&mdash;but
something not much more elevated; namely, that a bounty
should have been paid to one of the hospital surgeons in the
shape of an apprentice fee; thus making the holding one of the
most responsible offices in the profession&mdash;a condition, which
absolutely ignores relative eligibility of skill, steadiness, assiduity,
and humanity; and which recognizes them only in such shape
that the possession of office is practically made to depend on a
point absolutely extrinsic to any one important requisition recognized
by the public or the profession.</p>

<p>We need not insist on the tendency of this system to the
protection of idleness and incapacity, or the injustice inseparable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
from it to the young gentlemen whose interests it is supposed to
guard. One necessary consequence is obvious&mdash;namely, that the
hospitals, instead of having to select from the general body of
pupils, or from the more industrious or talented of them, is obliged
to choose from a very small minority.</p>

<p>It is, in fact, just as if scholarships and fellowships at public
schools and universities were conferred without any reference to the
proofs which the candidates might have given of their talents or
industry; but were distributed to those who had given a certain
fee to a particular professor. Would any man in his senses
doubt as to the influence of such a plan on the interests of
classical literature or mathematical science? It seems to us
impossible that men should really differ on that point, or hesitate
to admit that, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, whatever the science might be,
so far as the cultivation of it could be influenced by system, the
result must be alike prejudicial in all cases. We are, however,
far from arriving at the end of the System by this general statement.</p>

<p>The public and the government, uninformed or unmindful of
this "system," wish to consult authorities on professional matters.
They not unnaturally look to those who hold public appointments,
because these afford the <i>prestige</i> of extensive opportunity,
which is supposed to imply, and under a fair system would ensure,
skill and experience. Men are apt to look at a man's position,
without stopping to inquire <i>how</i> it was obtained; and although
position may cut both ways, and in particular instances "throw
a cruel sunshine" over incapacity, still amongst gentlemen extreme
cases are not to be expected; the rule is much more likely
to be a respectable and protected mediocrity, which is just that
tone which has rarely done anything to enlarge the boundaries
of any kind of knowledge.</p>

<p>It happens, however, from the "system," and the position
thus given to those who are supposed to profit by it, that the
interests of the poor, and, in a considerable degree, those of the
rich also, are, in a very large sense, confided to their care.</p>

<p>It thus follows that positions, in themselves highly desirable,
and which enable men to exert considerable influence on the progress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
of a science, on the sound condition of which the physical
comforts, and in no small degree the moral condition, of mankind
depend, are occupied by men who have undergone none of
those tests which public competition alone affords, and which the
<i>summi honores</i> of almost every other profession either directly or
indirectly imply.</p>

<p>So far for one mode in which the interests of the public are compromised;
but there are many other channels. The government,
ignoring the evils of this system, have placed the regulation of
the surgical branch of the profession in the hands of a body
of men whom, when we examine, we find to be no other
than the apprentices we had recognized at the hospital, grown
into the full bloom of a legislative body&mdash;whence again are chosen
Presidents, Vice-Presidents, Examiners, &amp;c., of the Royal College
of Surgeons of London!</p>

<p>If, fatigued with this machinery, we walk to the Royal Medical
and Chirurgical Society&mdash;a chartered body for the especial cultivation
of science&mdash;we meet, as its name would imply, a number
of our honoured brothers, the physicians; but here we find that,
whether we observe Presidents or any other Officers, the influence
exerted by the apprentice system continues; and that, in <i>almost</i>
everything surgical, the <i>best possible</i> individual is an apprentice
who has attained his first position without any public competition.
Can any one be surprised that the published transactions
of this society are not of a higher character. We hope and
believe that the point of the wedge is already inserted, which will,
at no distant period, rend asunder this system, which we shall
not trust ourselves by attempting to characterize farther. But
there are points in connection with the interests of science and of
Abernethy which require yet to be noticed.</p>

<p>We need scarcely observe that it would be very desirable that
the interests of science should be entrusted to those who had
shown most assiduity or talent in the cultivation of them; that
if operative surgery be really, as a whole, a series of facts exemplifying
the defects of a science&mdash;that whilst every pains should
be taken that what is necessary should be done thoroughly well&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
factitious inducement to multiply their number should be
avoided, and especially any which tended to increase emolument
commensurately with their multiplication.</p>

<p>That as operations (with some few exceptions) merely minister
to effects, their real bearings on disease can only be estimated by
knowing the <i>ultimate result</i>; and that, in order to this effect,
returns of all operations should be kept, with full accounts of
the cases; the addresses of the patients should also be taken,
and such means as were obvious and practicable employed to
obtain the <i>ultimate result</i> of the case.</p>

<p>Another point which should be attended to in hospitals, is an
accurate notation and return of all cases whatever; so that we
might obtain from statistical records whatever light they might
be capable of affording in aid of the prosecution of a definite
science. In this return, a full history, and <i>all</i> the phenomena of
the case, which are known to have an influence on the Body,
should be accurately noted, and in tabular forms convenient for
reference.</p>

<p>The defects of the hospitals in this respect are too well
known to require comment; and we think the profession indebted
to Dr. Webster for the exertions he has made to draw attention
to this subject. In no respect are the hospitals more defective
than as regards the division of labour<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor"><sup>75</sup></a>. To supply the requisitions
of a yet dawning science, there is too much confided to one
surgeon; for, at present, the practical administration and the
scientific investigation should be confided to the same hand. If
more be entrusted to one man than can be performed without
great labour, and the greater labour be voluntary, we shall have
little chance of obtaining that full and accurate notation of facts
which all cases furnish more or less the means of obtaining, and
without which the evolution of the maximum of human ability
is absolutely impossible. It seems to us also an imperative duty
to avail ourselves of the experience afforded by the history of
other sciences, in the cultivation of our own.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span></p>

<p>All sciences have been in as bad a condition as medicine and
surgery, or worse. All sciences have progressed immediately
that they were investigated on a rational plan&mdash;a plan, which,
simply stated, is little more than the bringing together <i>all the
facts</i> that can be perceived to bear any relation to the inquiry,
and reasoning on them according to <i>well-established</i> and necessary
conditions. If this be the case, and this plan have never
been applied to the investigation of medical science, we know not
how those who are placed in positions which supply the necessary
means can be excused; or how we can halt in condemning the
system under which such a flagitious neglect of the claims of
science and mankind is exemplified. It is true, when we arrive
at the acmé of our convictions of the effects of such a system,
our reflections remind us that such things are "permitted," and
that ultimately they will work for good; that Man is not destined
to interfere with the ultimate plan and designs of Providence,
however he may be allowed to place his intellect under the direction
of a responsible volition, and to discover the path to the
temple of truth, only after having fruitlessly threaded the mazes
of error.</p>

<p>We believe that there is no greater fallacy than that which
supposes that private advantage can be promoted at the expense
of the public good. We are very well disposed to believe that
selfish people are the very worst caterers for the real interests of
the idol they worship. The more we consider the Hospital
system, the more reason shall we find to distrust it; and we by
no means exclude that very point wherein it is supposed to be
most successful&mdash;namely, in securing the pecuniary advantage of
those whose interests it is supposed to serve.</p>

<p>Of the apprentices, we shall say little more than to express
our belief that many of them have lived to obtain the conviction
that they would have done much better had they not been fed by
hopes that were never realized. All apprentices cannot, of
course, be surgeons. Again, if, in the course of a century, a
solitary instance or two should occur of the success of an unapprenticed
candidate, they not unnaturally feel it as an injustice in
thus being deprived of that, the especial eligibility to which was
a plea for the exaction of a large apprentice fee. But to the
surgeons themselves, it seems to us that the system is far from
realizing the benefits that its manifold evils are supposed to secure.
The adage that "curses, like chickens, come home to roost," is
far from inapplicable. After all, many of the hospital surgeons
are little known; and the public inference with regard to
men invested with such splendid opportunities of distinguishing
themselves, is not very flattering. Mr. Abernethy, so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
from benefiting from the "System," appears to us to have suffered
from it in every way.</p>

<p>His talents, both natural and acquired, would have given him
every thing to hope and nothing to fear from the severest competition;
whilst the positive effects of the system were such as to
deprive him of what was justly his due, and to embitter a retirement
which in the barest justice should have been graced by
every thing that could add to his peace, his honour, or his happiness,
from the Institution whose character he had exalted and
maintained, and whose school he had founded.</p>

<p>But let us look at the facts. The system which pronounces
that there shall be three surgeons to attend to some 500 or 600
patients (<i>for the purposes of science</i>&mdash;the next thing to an impossibility),
kept Abernethy twenty-eight years an assistant surgeon.
During this time he was filling the hospital with students, to the
amount of sums varying from £2,000 to £3,000 a year, of
which, in the said twenty-eight years, he never received one
farthing.</p>

<p>He saw, from time to time, many men, of whose capacities we
know he had the highest opinion, shut out from the hospital by the
mere circumstance of their not having been apprentices; and two
of these were the late Professor Macartney, of Dublin, and the
present distinguished Professor of Comparative Anatomy, Professor
Owen. And here we must pause to record one of our
numerous obligations to the perceptivity and justice of Abernethy.
We have formerly observed that, at the very commencement of
life, he had been accustomed to inculcate the importance of
studying comparative anatomy and physiology, in order to obtain
clear views of the functions of Man; but all arrangements made
with this view, from the time of Mr. Hunter onwards, though varying
in degree, were still inefficient. It was next to an impossibility
to combine an availing pursuit of a science which involves an
inquiry into the structure and functions of the whole animal
kingdom, with the daily exigencies of an anxious profession.</p>

<p>When Mr. Owen had completed his education, his thoughts
were directed to a Surgeoncy in the navy, as combining a professional
appointment with the possibility of pursuing, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
increased opportunities of observation, his favorite study. Fortunately
for science, he went to Abernethy, who requested him to
pause. He said, "You know the Hospital will not have any but
apprentices. Macartney left on that account. Stay," said he,
"and allow me to think the matter over." This resulted in his
proposing to the Council of the College of Surgeons that there
should be a <i>permanent</i> Professor of Comparative Anatomy, and
that the appointment should be given to Mr. Owen.</p>

<p>This is among the many proofs of Abernethy's perception of
character. Mr. Owen had dissected for lecture; and Abernethy
saw, or thought he saw, a peculiar aptitude for more general and
enlarged anatomical investigation. The whole world now knows
how nobly the Professor has justified the hopes of his talented
master. It would be out of place for us to attempt a compliment
to a man so distinguished in a science, wherein the varied
pursuits of a practical profession allow us to be mere amateurs;
neither do we wish to forget other gentlemen who distinguish
themselves in this branch of science; but we believe that most
competent judges allow that the celebrated Cuvier has not
left any one more fitted to appreciate his excellence, or who has more
contributed to extend that science of which the Baron was so distinguished
a leader, than Professor Owen.</p>

<p>There is one incident, however, in the Professor's labours
which, for our own purposes, we must relate; because we shall
have to refer to it in our humble exhortation to the public and
the profession to believe in the practicability of raising Medicine
and Surgery into a definite science. The incident shows what
may be done by that mode of investigation which is the still delayed
desideratum in medicine and surgery&mdash;namely, the <i>most
comprehensive</i> record of facts, and the study of their <i>minutest relations</i>.
Professor Cuvier was the first to impress, in a special
manner, that those beautiful relations in the structure of animals,
so many of which are even popularly familiar, extended throughout
the animal; so that if any one part, however apparently subordinate,
were changed, so accurate were the adaptations in Nature,
that all parts underwent some corresponding modification; so
that diversity of structure in parts, more or less affected the
whole.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span></p>

<p>The beautiful result of all this is, that if these relations be
once thoroughly mastered, then any one part necessarily suggests,
in general terms, the nature of the animal to whom it belonged.
Few instances, however, so remarkable as the one we are about to
mention, could have been anticipated.</p>

<p>A seafaring man brought a piece of bone, about three or four
inches in length, as he said, from New Zealand, and offered it for
sale at one or two museums; amongst others, at the College of
Surgeons. We shall not here detain the reader by telling all that
happened. These things are often brought with intent to deceive,
and with false allegations. Most of those to whom the bone was
submitted, dismissed it as worthless, or manifested their incredulity.
Amongst other guesses, some rather eminent persons jocosely
hinted that they had seen bones very like it at the London Tavern;
regarding it, in fact, as part of an old marrow-bone, to which it
bore, on a superficial view, some resemblance. At length it was
brought to Professor Owen, who, having looked at it carefully,
thought it right to investigate it more narrowly; and after much
consideration, he ventured to pronounce his opinion. This
opinion, from almost anybody else, would have been perhaps only
laughed at; for, in the first place, he said that the bone (big
enough, as we have seen, to suggest that it had belonged to an
ox) had belonged to a bird. But before people had had time to
recover from their surprise or other sensation created by this
announcement, they were greeted by another assertion, yet more
startling&mdash;namely, that it had been a bird without wings.</p>

<p>Now, we happen to know a good deal of this story; and that
the incredulity and doubt with which the opinion was received
were too great, for a time, even for the authority of Professor
Owen to dispel. But mark the truthfulness of a real science;
contemplate the exquisite beauty and accuracy of relation in
nature! By and by, a whole skeleton was brought over to this
country, when the opinion of the Professor was converted into an
established fact. Nor was this all; there was this appropriate
symbol to perpetuate the triumph: that which had appeared as
the most startling feature of what had been scarcely better received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
than as a wild conjecture, was so accurate in fact, as to
form the most appropriate name to the animal thus discovered<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor"><sup>76</sup></a>.</p>

<p>It would be unjust to others to attribute Professor Owen's
appointment exclusively to Abernethy: that, the state of things
did not place within his single power; but his penetration was
the first to suggest, and his weight most potential in securing, an
appointment which various circumstances, besides the merits of
the individual, bring up in high relief, as the best ever made by
the London College of Surgeons.</p>

<p>To return to the Hospital System, as affecting Abernethy.
He continued to lecture, and the emoluments arising thence he of
course enjoyed. Until 1815, the whole of the hospital fees had
been taken by the surgeons in chief. These fees, in twenty-eight
years (allowing a reasonable deduction for those pupils who went
to the school independently of the inducement offered by the
most attractive lecturer ever known), must have amounted to an
enormous sum. Having founded the school, he became surgeon
at about fifty years of age; and then retired at sixty-two. On
retiring, unpleasant discussions arose, which, with others long
antecedent, rendered his concluding associations with the hospital
scarcely more agreeable than they had been at the College of
Surgeons.</p>

<p>The whole of Abernethy's closing career gave him no reason
to rejoice at the Hospital System. The circumstances, though
they convey a lesson in the History of the Lives of Men of Genius,
were, abstractedly, extremely unimportant. They show that
Abernethy, in his retiring hours, whilst his reputation had become
European, and Transatlantic<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor"><sup>77</sup></a>&mdash;whilst hundreds were benefiting
their fellow creatures, more or less, according to their talents and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
opportunities, in every part of the world&mdash;seems to have been
surrounded by men who, so far as we can see, were little disposed
to grace his retirement either with much sympathy, or even with
reasonably generous appreciation of all that he had done, either
for Science in general, or the Hospital in particular.</p>

<p>Instead of considering how they could best do honour to the
waning powers of one who had not only raised the reputation of
St. Bartholomew's Hospital to a point it had never before attained,
who had founded a school there, constituting the largest single
Hospital Class in London, and who was leaving the inheritance
of a rich annual harvest to his successors,&mdash;the time was occupied
in discussing whether he could resign the surgeoncy without
resigning the lectureship; whether, on paying a hundred guineas,
which there seemed no difficulty in receiving, he could become a
Governor whilst still an officer; and then, whether his being a
Lecturer without retaining the surgeoncy did not so constitute
him. These, and similar questions scarcely more important, were
the source of considerable annoyance.</p>

<p>In former editions, we were obliged to discuss some of these
matters more at large than is now necessary; because, amongst
the individuals associated in the transactions of the period, there
was one to whom Mr. Abernethy had been of especial service;
but in regard to whom he had been much misrepresented.
Further, this had taken place in our own hearing, in whose recollection
all the facts were perfectly fresh, but who were, at that time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
without the documents which are now in our possession. We
accordingly sought to obtain whatever documents there were from
the source most likely to test the correctness of our recollection;
when a note was written which, as we now learn, quite unintentionally
conveyed the idea, or at least was susceptible of the construction,
that a disinclination to make any communication on
the subject proceeded from a desire to withhold something unfavourable
to Mr. Abernethy. This determined us on discussing
the matter, so far as was necessary to rebut such interpretation.
And it was fortunate we did so; for it very soon appeared, not
only that such an impression had been produced, but that
"gossip," with its usual aptitude for invention, had soon supplied
the myth thus supposed to have been charitably withheld.</p>

<p>It was not very long after the publication of these Memoirs,
that we learned, in a conversation with a highly distinguished
member of the profession, that he had been led to entertain the
impression to which we have alluded. Here we had, of course,
an opportunity of correcting the error; but it obviously became
a subject of very serious consideration, what must be done in
dealing with this matter, and other matters arising out of it, in a
subsequent edition. To treat the affair seriously, would have involved
a reference to documents in our possession which, though
highly honorable to Mr. Abernethy, would have been of no general
interest, whilst they would have involved details disagreeable to
several persons. We therefore, after much consideration, resolved
on endeavouring to see whether it was not possible to quash a
tedious and painful discussion, and at the same time to obtain, of
course, all that was necessary to the memory of Mr. Abernethy.</p>

<p>The following letter, and the reply, will, we think, sufficiently
develop the very difficult and disagreeable position in which we
were placed; our sole object being, so far as it was possible, to
avoid repeating or enlarging a discussion which we had learned
would have given pain to certain parties. The concluding
paragraph has been omitted, as being unnecessary to the point
more immediately under discussion.</p>

<p class="sigright in0">"3, The Court Yard, Albany,&#8195;&#8195;<br />
"July 17th, 1856.</p>

<p class="sigleft in0">"Sir,</p>

<p>"For reasons which may be gathered from this note, I think
it proper to inform you that I am preparing another edition of
the Memoirs of Abernethy. Impressions have been conveyed
to certain persons, that the reasons on which you grounded your
disinclination to make any communication in relation to your
differences with Abernethy, were the desire you professed to withhold
something which involved imputations unfavourable to him.
Further, a sort of Body has been given to these vague impressions
by inferences which the documentary and other evidence
at my disposal enable me to disprove. In one quarter, the
circumstances are so strongly suggestive as to the sources
whence the erroneous impressions were derived, that it is impossible
to leave that portion of the Memoirs which treats of
your differences with Abernethy as it at present stands, without
the risk of injustice. It is regarded as necessary that you
should either recognize or ignore the inferences which (whether
correctly or not I will not presume in this place to determine)
have certainly been formed on your supposed authority. The
justice of such a course is sufficiently obvious. I need scarcely
say, it is immaterial to me what course is taken. If I am
obliged to enter into the discussion of the subject, I shall take
the opportunity of defending myself from the remarks that
have been made upon me, and of showing what I did say, as
well as what I might have said. These remarks are less excusable
from it being known to me that a letter of mine to a third
party was by my express permission read to you, in which was
stated my willingness to alter or modify any passage which
might have offended your feelings, provided only that such
alteration involved no injustice to Mr. Abernethy. The (as I
think) ill-advised rejection of the offer, coupled with the intimation,
long after, which was given to Mr. Longman by a friend
of yours, that certain papers would be forthcoming, provided
only that certain passages relating to Mr. Stanley were suppressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
will involve a discussion in which I shall now be very
unreserved; but which, I fear, will be scarcely less disagreeable
to you than painful to myself. If you ignore the imputations
to which I have referred, it seems to me that the whole discussion
may be quashed by your simply writing me a note, in which
you state as the reason for your not making any communication
to me your dislike to revive the recollection of differences with
one whose memory you will always regard with respect, gratitude,
and affection, or whatever other terms your feelings may
justify, or the claims of Mr. Abernethy require.</p>

say, that I have no information to give; for I am not in possession
of any document relating to it; and so many years have
elapsed since the occurrences to which you refer, that I could
not trust my memory for the accuracy of any statement, if I
were disposed to make it. You will therefore perceive that there
exists no foundation for the supposition that 'I desire to
withhold something which involved imputations unfavourable
to Mr. Abernethy,' or that any other feelings than those
of the utmost respect for the memory of Mr. Abernethy have
existed in my mind.</p>

<p>We here conclude this subject.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span></p>

<p>A somewhat amusing illustration of one feature of the
hospital system occurred about this time. Sir Astley Cooper had,
without the smallest intention to give offence, made some observation
on the somewhat too free use of Mercury at that period in
the Borough Hospitals. His observations having been misunderstood
or misrepresented, he took occasion to remove any idea of
intentional offence, by addressing the class. Among other things,
he is reported to have said: "Why, gentlemen, was it likely
that I should say any thing unkind towards these gentlemen?
Is not Mr. Green my godson, Mr. Tyrrell my nephew, Mr.
Travers my apprentice" (the three surgeons of St. Thomas's
Hospital), "Mr. Key my nephew, Mr. Cooper my nephew?"
(surgeons of Guy's)<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor"><sup>78</sup></a>.</p>

<p>This was very <i>naïve</i>, and is an illustration of the value of
evidence in proof of facts having no necessary connection with
those it was intended to establish.</p>

<p>It is difficult to conceive any one more disinterested than Mr.
Abernethy had been in relation to the surgeoncy of the hospital,
from the moment at which he was appointed to the hour of his
resignation. Although he had waited twenty-eight years as
assistant, and not participated in one farthing of the large sums
accruing from his reputation in hospital pupil fees&mdash;although,
too, he had a large family,&mdash;yet, so far was he from wishing to
indemnify himself for this long exclusion from office by a
lengthened tenure of it, that he at once announced his opinion as
to the expediency of earlier resignations of the surgeoncies, and
his intention of acting on it when he should have attained his
sixtieth year. His reasons were liberal and judicious. Amongst
others, he said that he had "often witnessed the evils resulting
from men retaining the office of surgeons to hospitals when
the infirmities of age prevented them from performing their
duties in an efficient manner. That, at sixty, he thought they
should resign in favour of the juniors," &amp;c.; thus contemplating
a tenure of only ten years. Again, he who had founded a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
school from such small beginnings as could be accommodated in
a private house in an obscure neighbourhood (Bartholomew Close),
taken for that purpose&mdash;who had so increased it, that a theatre
was built within the hospital&mdash;this again pulled down and rebuilt
of enlarged dimensions to receive his increasing audiences&mdash;having,
too, some time previously made over his museum to the
hospital, in trust for the use of the school,&mdash;required that his
only son (should he <i>prove competent in the opinion of the medical
officers</i>) should in due time&mdash;Do what? Succeed him? No;
but be admitted to a <i>share</i> in the lectures.</p>

<p>Indeed, Mr. Abernethy's closing career at the hospital gave
him no great reason to rejoice at the "hospital system." Men,
who could see nothing in leaving very much more important
situations to an indefinite succession of apprentices, cavilled at a
prospective lectureship for his only son; whilst his lectures were
delivered over to gentlemen&mdash;one of whom had, from an early
period, ridiculed, as he said, the opinions which he taught as&mdash;and
which we now know to have been&mdash;John Hunter's; and another,
with whom there had been of late several not very pleasing
associations.</p>

<p>This was necessarily a result of the "hospital system;" a
system that gave a still more melancholy and fatal close to the
labours of John Hunter, whose death took place suddenly in the
Board-room of St. George's Hospital, whilst resisting an interference
with a privilege which his love of science rendered valuable
to him, and which it was for the interests of science that he
should enjoy; but, mournful as these results are, and many
others that might be added, still, if we found that the system
worked well for science, we might rest satisfied; but is it so?
What advances have the hospital surgeons of London, <i>under the
apprentice system</i>, made in the science of surgery? Let those
answer the question who are desirous of maintaining this system.
For our own parts, the retrospect seems to show "the system" in
a more striking manner than any thing we have yet stated.
John Hunter, that <i>primus inter omnes</i>, was no hospital apprentice;
he migrated from St. Bartholomew's, where the
rule was too exclusive to give him a chance, to St. George's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
where he obtained admittance; St. Bartholomew's preserved
"the system," and lost Hunter.</p>

<p>Abernethy was an apprentice, truly; but all those glorious
labours which shed such a lustre on his profession, and such a
benefit on mankind, were completed long before he became
surgeon to St. Bartholomew's Hospital; and it is material to
repeat that at that time the assistant surgeons, with the exceptions
already stated, had nothing to do. In casting our eyes
over the retrospect of years, one honoured name attracts our
notice, in connection with a real advance in the knowledge of the
functions of nerves. We allude to Sir Charles Bell. But here
again "the system" is unfortunate; for Sir Charles was never a
hospital apprentice at all, and only succeeded to a post in a
London hospital after an open canvass in an institution in which
the narrow portal of the apprentice system is unrecognized.</p>

<p>We might have traced the effects of the apprentice system
into the more covert sites of its operations, as exemplified in the
abortive or mischievous legislation observed at different times in
the College of Surgeons of London; or have extended the catalogue
we formerly exposed as taking place in the Royal Med. and
Chir. Society up to the influence&mdash;proh pudor!&mdash;that it is
allowed to exert in the Councils of the Royal Society; but our
so doing here would have led us into discussions which are
irrelevant or unnecessary to our present objects. In the meantime,
it is useful to remark that there are two sides to all
questions. If, in our corporate bodies, we see the prurient
appetencies of trade usurping the place of the lofty aspirations of
science,&mdash;if we see this carried to the extent of men allowing
themselves to receive money without rendering any intelligible
account of its amount,&mdash;let us not forget that there is a Public&mdash;aye,
and a Profession too&mdash;which calmly allows such things.</p>

<p>Let us also reflect on those numerous instances, in human
affairs, of things being only accomplished when there is a real
necessity for them; and, again, whether that necessity for a higher
and purer administration of corporate privileges and scientific
distinctions may not alone reside in a higher and purer moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
standard on the part of the public and the profession. Those
who, in a worldly sense, suffer from the system, have at least the
consolation that they are not obliged to participate in the administration
of that which they disapprove; and that the losses
they so sustain are perhaps necessary tests of their having
achieved proper motives. No better proof of the sincerity and
earnestness of our love of science can be afforded us, than a patient
and thoughtful cultivation of it, independently of patronage,
position, or other auxiliaries, which too often mask from us the
true objects of research, sully the purity of mind by mixtures of
questionable motive, or mislead us from the temple of truth to
the altar of a fugitive and fallacious ambition. There are indeed
signs of a "<i>Delenda est Carthago</i>." As we have said, the point
of the wedge is inserted, and a very little extension of public
information will at no distant period drive it home.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Medical Science, instead of being in a position
to receive every quackery as a means of demonstrating the superior
beauty of truth, by placing it in contrast with error, is obliged to
regard any absurdity, however gross, as one of the hydra-headed
fallacies through which we are to evolve what is true, only by the
circuitous plan of exhausting the resources of hypothesis and
conjecture: whilst sweeping epidemics, which, wholesomely regarded,
should be looked on reverently as besoms of destruction,
are hailed by the observant as melancholy, but necessary, impulses,
to drive us to the adoption of measures, to which our capital of
common sense is not sufficient to induce us to listen.</p>

<p>Neither are the old hospitals the only parts of a defective system.
There is no hospital in London that, even yet, has any country
establishment for convalescents; whilst of two of those more recently
established, one is built over a church-yard; and the other,
intended only for the relief of decarbonizing organs, is placed in
the immediate neighbourhood of the most smoky metropolis in
Europe. Both, therefore, instead of standing out as the most
distinguished illustrations of the laws of sanitary and physiological
science, being, on the contrary, emphatic examples of their
violation.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span></p>

<p>We are unwilling to conclude this chapter without observing
that, notwithstanding the coldness and discussions which threw
somewhat of melancholy and shade over Abernethy's retiring days,
thus presenting an unwelcome contrast with the more palmy
periods of his career&mdash;a contrast from which it might have been
hoped his conscientious retirement might have spared him,&mdash;we yet
see how appropriate a preparation it might have been for a transition
from the exciting, and adulatory, atmosphere which surrounds a
popular and scientific teacher, as compared with the calmness and
peace of a life in the country. He was now no more to enter the
Hospital Square, where we have so often seen him mobbed, as it were,
by the crowding and expectant pupils; no more to be daily addressing
audiences who never seemed to tire even with repetitions of that
with which many were already familiar; nor any more to see, as
occasional visitors, men grown grey in the successful practice of his
early lessons, bringing their sons to the same school, and both
listening with equal pleasure. There is no doubt that, contrasted
with all this, retirement was a great, though now probably a
welcome, change. Eminent men unintentionally exert an influence
which is not without its evils; and we shall see that of
this he was fully aware. Assentation is too much the order of the
day. The multitude appear to agree. The few who differ, are
apt to be cautious or reserved. If a man is too sensible to be
fed with such garbage as direct flattery, there are always tricksters
or tacticians, who have a thousand ways of paying homage without
detection.</p>

<p>Then, again, those who really admire a man, and are honest,&mdash;keep
aloof, and shrink from an association with those whom they
know, or believe, to be parasites. It thus happens that there are
men to whom so few venture to be honest, that the world may
present little better than a practical lie. It is a mercy then, when
a man's sun is setting, that he be blessed with a little twilight of
truth.</p>

<p>There are, in the moral and intellectual constitution, as well
as in the physical endowments of Man, beneficent powers of
adaptation, which let us gently down to contrasts, which, too
sudden, might be painful or destructive.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span></p>

<p>There is, however, this difference&mdash;the external senses have
intrinsic powers of adaptation so ready, and perfect, as scarcely to
be taken by surprise by any natural transition. The moral and
intellectual powers do not appear to possess this electric activity;
but require slower gradations of impression, which, by some law
in the progress of human affairs, are (as the rule) mercifully
supplied.</p>

<p>In his own lessons, whenever he met with any <i>apparent</i> imperfection,
and wished to impress its <i>real</i> beauty of adaptation,
Abernethy was very fond of what he termed his argumentum ex
absurdo. He would suppose various other arrangements, and
point out in succession their unfitness for the purposes required.
Tried in the same manner, we can see nothing better than that
which really happened.</p>

<p>If Abernethy met with coldness where he expected warmth&mdash;and
dispute and discussion where he might have calculated on
grateful concession,&mdash;how well-fitted must have been that reverence
and affection which longingly awaited his retirement at home. If
the greatest worldly success, in that occupation in which he had
always felt most pleasure, was still not without its dark lights&mdash;shadowing
forth what the world really is,&mdash;what could he have
had better to concentrate his views on those substantial sources
of comfort, of which he had long believed and estimated the value,
and on which he was contented to repose. It had always been a
favourite expression of his, when in any doubt or difficulty:
"Well, I will consult my pillow, and we shall see." We believe
that pillow seldom flattered.</p>

years, with Professor Ethelbert Dudley, of Lexington, Kentucky, and from the
evidence it affords of Abernethy's principles having been recognized, and practised
with great success, by one of the most distinguished surgeons and successful
operators in the Western World. Professor E. Dudley, himself a distinguished
surgeon and lecturer, and a man who unites with an extremely clear and vivacious
perceptivity, a most untiring zeal in his profession, is the nephew of the
celebrated B. Dudley, whose fame extends through the great Mississippi Valley.
This gentleman, now advanced in years, was an early pupil of Abernethy, of
whom he is a great admirer. He is a remarkably successful operator, and, during
his more active period, was sometimes sent for several hundred miles. He
is said to have performed lithotomy 200 times, with the loss of only six cases.
His unusual success in operations he attributes not so much to any peculiar
dexterity as to the manner in which he conducts the preparatory and subsequent
portions of the Constitutional treatment of his cases. He seems also to
have practised some other of Abernethy's habits: the most careful consideration
of the pecuniary circumstances of his patients, interspersed with not a few
examples of almost unexampled generosity.</p>

<p class="center bold in0 p2t">HIS RELIGION.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"Philosophy directs us to bear evils with patience and fortitude, because they
are inevitable; but Christianity gives us consolation under sufferings, by assuring
us that they are but the discipline of a Parent who loveth while he chastiseth,
and that they are but for a moment, when compared with eternity. The Christian's
Hope has made him whom it has supported rejoice under the greatest sufferings
that mortality could endure; yet Hope is but the offspring of faith, and
therefore it was necessary to make faith the foundation of the structure of the
Christian Religion, and to assign and affix to it peculiar privileges and rewards."
<span class="smcap">Mr. Abernethy<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor"><sup>79</sup></a>.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Whoever reflects on the influence produced on the mind by
research in Science, will, we think, arrive at a very important
conclusion.</p>

<p>It is true that, at the commencement, numerous worldly
motives tend to place most prominently before us the temporal
advantages of scientific Inquiry. There are distinctions of wealth,
rank, position, which not unfrequently await its successful cultivation.
Then there are the multiform applications of science in
extending the enjoyments, in ministering to the wants, and, still
better, relieving the calamities of mankind; but when we have
arrived at this, surely the acmé of its <i>utilitarian</i> allurements, we
find there are still higher motives engendered&mdash;that science has a
still richer harvest to encourage its onward cultivation. Nor is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
it too much to say, that, if cultivated aright, the fruits may be
more surely garnered than any of those to which we have previously
referred. The harvest we mean consists of those moralizing
influences which, however neglected, are never separable from
the study of Nature; which, however ordinary the impulses with
which the inquiry may have commenced, slowly overlay it with
motives and feelings which lead us to investigate Nature for the
sake of truth alone. And here, we think, first dawns upon us
the conclusion to which we have alluded: viz. that the highest
attractions of science are to be found in what we venture to term
its "Religion."</p>

<p>However much the influences first mentioned tend to place
the more lofty suggestions of science in temporary abeyance,
there always comes a time when the sincere inquirer begins to feel
a double current of thought. In the one, the thoughts are open,
aspiring&mdash;ambitious, it may be&mdash;public, and directed only to the
laws and phenomena of Nature; in the other, they are calm, deep,
humble, silent, and <i>will</i> turn to the Supreme Cause. The former
may foster his ambition, animate his research, sustain his industry.
The latter carry him beyond those influences, and supplies
something which they cannot give. In loving truth for its own
sake, he learns by degrees to lean little on the worldly appreciation
of labour&mdash;convinced that whatever is true, will one day find
its own way, in the time best fitted for it. We cannot help thinking
that it is the force of this double current of thought by
which that climax has been reached by some of the greatest minds;
which has exemplified the coincidence of the utmost range of
human knowledge with the most profound humility; thus rendering
the highest aspirations of science subservient to the cultivation
of a principle; inseparable, we suppose, from all Religion;
but certainly one of the most distinguishing characteristics of
Christianity.</p>

<p>An idea, however, has arisen in some minds, that the pursuit
of science has a tendency to make men sceptical in Religion.
This we believe to be not only a demonstrable, but a dangerous
error&mdash;demonstrable, as remarkably opposed to the evidences of
fact and observation; and dangerous, as withdrawing the minds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
of many from the study of science, who would be perhaps especially
fitted to estimate its advantages and enjoy its pleasures.</p>

<p>History, who from her ample store of testimony has so often
repealed injustice and defeated error, is no where more conclusive
than on the question before us. The study of Nature not only
has no tendency to induce a state of mind unfavorable to the reception
of the truths of Religion, but just the contrary; for the
proofs of a humble and sincere reliance on the promises of the
one, have been infinitely most striking in those who have proved
themselves the most successful cultivators of the other.</p>

<p>The philosopher, regarding the universe as the dwelling of
the Supreme, sees in the laws of nature, and in the powers through
which he is permitted in a degree to interpret them, only another
revelation&mdash;a Divine recognition of his high relations and destiny;
and grasps in one comprehensive idea the Word and the Works,
as an integral communication&mdash;one extended privilege to Man.
He does not indeed confound the evidences on which philosophical
and religious truths respectively repose. He knows that they
rest on different <i>kinds</i> of testimony, which he neither strives to
identify, nor misapply. He no more expects to deduce the generalizations
of science from the Scriptures, than he does the commands
of the Deity from the facts of the natural world. Philosophy
and Religion, however, are constantly impressing similar
facts. In science, we learn&mdash;and no doubt the deepest learn it best&mdash;that
"there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt
of in our philosophy." Religion tells us there are many things
"past man's understanding." Religion and science teach us alike
that any inquiry into the positive and ultimate nature of anything
which exists, is entirely beyond our faculties; and respectively impress
on us the conviction, that our proper business is to search
out the phenomena and laws of the one, and to obey the Commandments
of the other.</p>

<p>Philosophy is daily teaching us how little we know, as compared
with that which is unknown. Religion informs us that, at
present, we see "through a glass darkly." Yet, at the same time,
both concur in encouraging us to believe that everything that is
really required of us, everything that is good and useful to us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
both here and hereafter, are alike open to human capacity. The
pursuit of science, no doubt, establishes requisitions which are
essential to the proper study of it. A mind undisciplined by any
rule; a mind taking only a conjectural view of nature; a mind
allowing fancy or imagination to usurp the place of intellectual
power; a condition which ignores the guidance of patience, circumspection,
and industry, and which seeks the explanation of
the impressions made on the senses by ingenious hypotheses made
to fit them; or which sees no order or intelligibility in anything
which it does not at once comprehend; that these and many
other states of mind <i>may</i> tend to confound the understanding,
and replace anything rational or profitable by anything else, is
<i>possible</i> enough. But is it not equally true of Religion? Experience
has abundantly shown us the result of Man trying to fit
the mysteries of Religion to the measure of intelligibility set up
by the human intellect. There surely is no subject on which men
have become more lamentably bewildered. This, however, is
merely one of the too common examples of abuse of our faculties;
and that such men may become sceptical, whether pursuing
Science or any subject whatever, is probable. It is, in truth,
"Science falsely so called," and has no more relation to the legitimate
study of Nature, than the most orderly formula of the mathematician
has to the wildest conjecture.</p>

<p>But that research in science, legitimately conducted, has any
tendency to produce what is usually intended by the term scepticism,
is not only improbable;&mdash;it is directly contradicted by the
facts of experience. So numerous are the examples of the contrary,
to which we here add the name of Abernethy, that it is difficult
to select, so as not to leave the evidence unjustifiably bald
on the one hand; or to render it superfluous even to tediousness
on the other. That which confers, however, the greatest interest
on this part of the subject, is not so much the <i>mass</i> of testimony,
not so much the <i>crowd</i> of witnesses, as the peculiar, yet varied,
character of the august assemblage. It is extremely significant
to observe, that whilst we find amongst the most earnest advocates
of the paramount importance of Revealed Truth, the names of the
most successful students of the Truths of Science,&mdash;so, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
other hand, no persons have laboured to impress us with the important
uses of the facts in nature with more zeal and success
than distinguished Divines. Amongst the many scientific men
who have exemplified the purifying tendencies of scientific pursuits
in promoting their reverence for Revealed Religion, it will
suffice to mention such names as Boyle, Bacon, Kepler, Newton,
Locke. The latter too reminds us that the medical profession
has contributed no small number of witnesses; of whom, Böerhaave,
Linnæus, Sloane, and Haller, are a few of the more illustrious
examples. All the foregoing are men who have explored one or more
of the ample fields of Nature; some of them, extending their views
beyond the planet we inhabit, into the whole visible universe, have
come back, showing us how to understand the necessity, and estimate
the value, of Revealed Truth; converting, it may be, in many
instances, Belief (so called) into a positive Faith; and a passive
assent into an earnest and clear conviction.</p>

<p>But, as we have said, Divines have not been slow in contributing
the weight of their testimony to the value of natural
evidence, and the acceptable assistance afforded by a contemplation
of the laws and the mysteries of Nature. So abundant indeed
are these mysteries, that there is not a path of our progress by
day, nor a waking thought by night, that does not at times present
some of them to our reflection. Mysteries in operation so clear,
that our very senses take cognizance of them; so orderly, that
when we are allowed to discover the law which regulates them, we
are at a loss which most to admire, the power, the number, or the
simplicity of its manifestations; and yet which, as to their intrinsic
nature, are so recondite as to be entirely beyond our researches; leaving
us, in fact, no faculty which can deal with them, but faith alone.
Divines have shown the value they attach to all such facts, by the
admirable application they have made of them in aiding the cultivation
of Religion&mdash;sometimes by teaching the necessity and
reasonableness of faith in the mysteries of Religion; at others, in
impressing the nature and attributes of the Supreme.</p>

<p>It would be easy to produce a longer roll of such men; but
most readers are acquainted with such names as Cudworth, Butler,
Sturm, Derham, Paley, Crombie, who have, in one or other sense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
exemplified the importance of natural knowledge, and the interest
they took in its cultivation. In every phase of the investigation,
we meet with fresh examples of the union of Religion with Science.
Paschal and St. Pierre are eminent illustrations. Paschal was a
Divine, and an eminent mathematician: mankind is surely under
obligations to him for his "Lettres Provinciales." These extraordinary
compositions must have operated with uncommon force
against the sophistries of the Jesuits; and, considering the nature
of the subject, it could have been no ordinary work that could
have induced Voltaire to say that he had never read anything more
humorous than the earlier letters, or more sublime than the later.
St. Pierre<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor"><sup>80</sup></a>, too, should not be passed without mention. His book
is, in some points of view, one of the most interesting works ever
written: occasionally fanciful or enthusiastic, it is a most unusually
rich collection of facts and observations. How excellently
adapted it is to encourage observation of natural phenomena!
How just and philanthropic&mdash;how circumspect and comprehensive
his observations in Nature! and how excellent and free from
cant the paramount importance he impresses of Religion as a
principle, and of Christianity as the perfect supply of all that is
necessary to us in time or in eternity. Yet St. Pierre was a
soldier; and it is to our present purpose that he was a scientific
man, and an engineer. Neither should we pass unnoticed the
numerous associations of pastoral care with the observation of
nature, so pleasingly exemplified in White of Selborne, and Gilpin
of the New Forest&mdash;men whose books we count now rather
by generations than editions, and which suggest to our imagination
the additional gratification which such men must have derived
to their favourite pursuits, in the continued sanction
afforded by Scripture. We would reverently point to the site
first chosen as the abode of purity and innocence; and the
numerous illustrations from nature contained in the Sacred
Volume; whether in enforcing general rules, or a special command&mdash;impressing
a particular principle, or illustrating a recondite
mystery,&mdash;and especially that which is a <i>remarkable and
necessary combination</i> of mystery with faith. For whilst it is, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
well as other mysteries, beyond our comprehension, it commands
so entire a faith in its reality, as to be, in some form or other,
instinctive and universal<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor"><sup>81</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Abernethy, it has been stated in former editions, was, as
regards his religious tenets, a member of the Church of England:
and it would have been gratifying to have included some of those
sentiments on religious and moral matters which we now record;
but, although some of these documents had been open to our
inspection before the completion of the second edition, they were
not so entirely at our disposal as Miss Abernethy has subsequently
placed them. Of these documents, those which relate to religious
and moral subjects consist, first, of a small book on the Mind,
which Abernethy published a great many years ago, anonymously;
and certain reflections, found amongst the very few MSS. which
he had preserved. Amongst these papers, there are two which
are in the form of sermons; and, although they are all somewhat
fragmentary, they are in several points of view more or less
interesting.</p>

<p>As it appears to be an abuse of the proper business of biography
to publish every thing that an eminent man says or does,
we shall endeavour to make such selection as shall fall within its
legitimate objects&mdash;viz. as establishing some fact of importance,
as illustrating the tone and character of the man, or as placing
some conclusion which had been drawn more or less from general
observation, on the more secure basis of the sentiments he has
himself recorded.</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">EXTRACTS.</p>

<p>There is "more moral certainty in the greater number of
instances of those things which we believe from the deduction
of reason, than of those we believe from the action of the
senses."</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>Yet he would warn the students of science "from being
proud of their acquisitions; and against not believing any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
thing but what they learn from the deductions of their reason,
lest they <i>become most ignorant of that of which they are most
assured</i>."</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>"Man at this period of the world is still ignorant of the
nature of surrounding bodies; his information must be
limited as his perceptions are limited, and this should produce
humility, the proper frame of mind for Christians."</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>After saying that we have no means of forming any idea of
the nature of matter, but from the impressions we receive from it,
those of figure, divisibility, gravity, and disposition to move when
impelled, to continue in motion unless retarded, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;in
allusion to a well-known theory, he adds: "But some have doubted
whether we could be sure even of those properties of matter
of which we felt most confident the existence were such as we
conceived them to be. Certainly," he says, "we know nothing
of what matter really is; we only know certain properties,
without being at all acquainted with the substratum or subject,
as a logician would say, which supports these properties.
Yet," he says, "when we consider the ideas derived from external
objects, we <i>cannot but admire their correctness and
suitability to our present wants and state of existence</i>."</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>"If we are ignorant of the nature of the most common
object of matter, as we call it, how can we obtain any knowledge
of what we call Spirit?" He thinks that it is only from
a knowledge of ourselves that we can derive any ideas on the
subject.</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>"When we examine our bodies, we see an assemblage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
of organs formed of what we call matter, visible to the
eye and cognizable to the touch; but, when we examine our
minds, we feel that there is something sensitive and intelligible
which inhabit our bodies." "We naturally believe in the
existence of a Supreme First Cause. We feel our own free agency.
We distinguish right and wrong. We feel as if we were
responsible for our conduct, and the belief in the existence of
a <i>future state seems indigenous to the mind of man</i>." "We
are conscious of our existence; we remember our sensations;
we compare them, judge of them, and Will and act in consequence
of such judgment." He thinks if we can form any notion of
the actions of a Spirit, it must be from reflections on such phenomena,
and not from any hypothetical definitions of Matter
and Spirit.</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>Again, after insisting on the limitation of our powers, he
says, "From them we may conceive of God, that He approves
what is right, and condemns what is wrong; and that he may
approve of our conduct when we act right or wrong, according
to our own ideas of rectitude or error. We cannot conceive
that God would have given us the power of judging without
deciding on the rectitude or error of our conduct in conformity
to such power or judgment. This is the sense in which
I understand the Scriptures&mdash;that God created man in His
own image."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">HIS TENDENCY TO REASON BY ANALOGY.</p>

<p>"As the Mind takes cognizance of what is passing in the
body, and in those which surround it and directs its notions
and operations in regard to them, so we may conceive of that
Great Spirit, the Soul of the universe, that He perceives and
governs all its parts. That Creator, Supporter, and Governor
of the universe, whom we are taught to address, not only as
such, but by the more endearing appellation of the Father of
our Spirits."</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span></p>

<p>In his little book on Mind, he thus lays out his plan:</p>

<p>"The attributes of the mind, which seem to be of a permanent
nature, are here considered as 'properties' (intending
such as perception, memory, &amp;c.); those which are occasionally
exerted and operate with effort as 'powers;' and those which
may be perceived only occasionally, and which vary in degree or
kind in different persons, as 'qualities.' As Reason and Will
are 'properties' of the mind, and yet exerted as 'powers,' they
are treated under both heads."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">OF IDEAS.</p>

<p>"As I may not use the word in a customary sense, I think
it right to explain what I mean by ideas. When I see a
beautiful prospect illuminated by the sun, I have a <i>perception</i>
of light and shade. When, however, I have acquired such a
knowledge of light and shade as to be able to represent on
paper a spherical or many-sided body, I think I have acquired
a knowledge of light and shade beyond that which the <i>mere</i>
remembrance of my perception would have produced. I shall,
therefore, express myself as follows: Our knowledge consists
of perceptions and deduction from them, which may be called
ideas, opinions, thoughts. In reasoning, we employ these
intellectual deductions, as we employ the perceptions of the
facts themselves."</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">OF ABSTRACTION.</p>

<p>He observes: "It does not appear that we have the power
of abstracting the mind from the consideration of any subject,
except by engaging it in some other."</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span></p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">OF BENEVOLENCE.</p>

<p>"Benevolence is necessary, because it enlarges our sphere of
happiness by rendering us participators in the happiness of
others&mdash;besides producing, by sympathy, similar feelings in
others."</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>In a series of propositions on the exercise of mind, he impresses
the mischief of admitting or indulging erroneous trains of
thought, as illustrated by "the fears arising from bad management
in childhood,&mdash;by persistence in vice after the gratification has
ceased and the destruction certain; and also in contributing
to the production of insanity." Or, on the other hand, he considers
the <i>advantage</i> of exercise in correct trains of thought;
that the powers evinced by Newton, and, in certain cases, by
Johnson, to have been unattainable, but as the result of such
exercise. He enlarges on the moral effects of habitual increase
of power in diverting the mind at will to other objects, and so
subduing anger, mitigating calamity, &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>In illustrating the intensity that recurrence of impression is
apt to give to the feelings, he says: "Benevolence indulged,
leads to lasting friendship; whilst the harbouring sensations of
even trivial disgust are too likely to develop animosity," &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>In speaking of the difficulty of ascertaining all the <i>facts</i> and
<i>feelings</i> which enter into the formation of any one's opinions,
he says: "It ought to incline us to think modestly of our own,
and pay deference to those of others,"</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>The impropriety of "anything like compulsion to make men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
think alike by other than <i>their own temperately induced convictions</i>
is never more clear than in regard to religion; for the
aim of Christianity is general benevolence and individual
humility&mdash;benevolence even to the forgiveness of error. Has
not this been illustrated in the highest degree by its Supreme
Author, when He said, 'Father, forgive them; they know not
what they do?' Does not Christianity enjoin the very
reverse of that which we are constantly pursuing, by which we
excite dissension and cultivate an arrogance incompatible with
the character of a Christian."</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>He concludes one chapter thus:</p>

<p>If we said to others, who agree in the main points of religion,
"We are brothers, let each think as his own mind dictates,&mdash;it
is probable that all would soon think alike, because all would
think without passion or prejudice."</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>He considers the most exalted of all manifestations of divine
mercy, "the atonement of sin by the sufferings of Christ, and
the promulgation of precepts which, if practised, ensure temporal
and eternal happiness." And, in another place, he speaks
of the gratitude that man should feel in "that his Creator has
thus condescended to be his Redeemer," &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>Of the Scripture precept&mdash;"To do justice, to love mercy,
and to walk humbly with thy God"&mdash;he observes, "that it
contains precepts so clear as to be intelligible to any capacity&mdash;so
strikingly just as to gain our immediate accordance&mdash;and
so comprehensive as to include every event which can occur
in life," &amp;c. Yet he says, "it is the property of truth, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
beautiful it may appear at first sight, to seem more and more
so, in proportion as it is minutely examined." MSS.</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>In deprecating pride, whether of mind, body, or estate, after
discussing the latter, he remarks on the more seductive influence
of intellectual superiority; he says: "The mind is no more ours
than the body;" that the success of intellect depends on
varieties of opportunity, qualities of mind, &amp;c.; that all are alike
given us, and that any merit which the mind may bring, consists,
not in the successes of intellect, but in the purity of the motive
by which they are guided.</p>


<hr class="style1" />

<p class="center bold in0 p2t p1b">PRIDE OF POSITION.</p>

<p>"It requires great and constant reflection to prevent a man
from becoming vain, who is placed in high office. He receives
such constant deference and respect to his opinions and wishes
from all around him, such ready obedience, that he might be
led to imagine he was a creature of superior order."</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>In some memoranda connected with things which had vexed
him, we find: "If justice, good will, and candour, were common,
the world would be too happy; it would not be what it now is&mdash;a
state of exertion and trial; of strenuous efforts, which
contribute to the general good; and, when efforts are unavailing,
of trials which demand fortitude, patience, and submission."
MSS.</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>In allusion to some preceding reflections, "It being intended to
show that the conduct enjoined by the Scriptures is the same that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
philosophy should inculcate, and that the preceding considerations
would not only almost persuade, but oblige every one to
be a Christian in conduct, whatever he might be in creed."</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>"To me it seems that the inspired origin of Christianity
may be fairly inferred from its wonderful adaptations to the
wants and feelings of the human mind. The Author of the
Christian Religion knew the mind of man, and all those feelings
and considerations which support and confirm him in well-doing.
That feelings, to become vivid, strong, and habitual, must be
often repeated; and therefore that prayer and the ceremonials of
Religion were not only right, but due to that Power by whose
ordinances we live, and move, and have our being. How
perfect a knowledge of the human mind evince those precepts
which instruct us, distrusting our own constancy, to shun
temptation and evil society. To engage ourselves in constant
and useful employment, and to suppress the first movements of
the mind, which, if continued, would urge us with increased
force and velocity to error. Human observation teaches that
the feelings of man are the source of their happiness or misery,
and the causes of their conduct. The Christian Religion
operates on our feelings, by teaching us the government of the
mind, and showing that Christianity does not consist merely in
evil doing, but in evil thinking."</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>We here conclude the extracts which we think it necessary
to submit to the reader, and we hope that they have not been
more than in keeping with the objects we proposed to observe.
In all the reasoning in his papers, Abernethy, whether we suppose
him right or wrong, is remarkably clear and consistent. If
he discourses on matter, or spirit, or any other principle, he
simply regards the phenomena they can be made to exhibit, regardless
of any opinion mankind may have formed as to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
<i>real</i> nature. He regards our ignorance of the intrinsic nature
of matter or spirit merely as an example of our ignorance of
that which is beyond the scope of our present faculties. This, in
science, is <i>studying</i> facts and laws, as contrasted with speculation
and conjecture; in religion, it seems to be attention to the
Command and the study of the Word, as contrasted with that of
the intrinsic nature of Him who gave it; and, in thus suggesting
the legitimate path of mind in regard to both, is at once
philosophical and religious.</p>

<p>It would have been easy to have multiplied the analogies of
science and religion, and especially those which, in warning us
before hand of those difficulties which occur in the prosecution of
science, tend to gird us with the requisite firmness and moderation
in bearing up against, or in surmounting them. Few have
cultivated science with success, without encountering more or
less of those evils which have been so commonly opposed to the
more devoted advocates of religion. So, also, some of the most
useful discoveries have been the mission of men of obscure
origin. Again, discoveries in science have frequently had to
brave distrust, ridicule, injustice, and all kinds of opposition.
It would, indeed, seem that nothing really good can in this world
be attained without sacrifice; much less truth&mdash;that best of all;
and he among us who is not prepared, in his search for the truths
of Science, to add his mite of something that the world most
values, might perhaps as well take Science as he finds it, and
avoid a labour which, without sacrifice, will be almost certainly
abortive.</p>

<p>That Abernethy's idea of religion was eminently practical, is
every where apparent in his reflections; yet, while he seems to
have felt that "faith, without works, is dead," he unmistakeably
evinces his conviction as to the foundation on which he thinks
<i>good</i> works can alone be secured.</p>

<p>The extracts we have made, and all Abernethy's writings,
appear to bear witness to a marked sincerity of character.
We see that, whether he lectured at the College of Surgeons,
or spoke to his pupils, who paid him for his instructions&mdash;whether
he addressed the public who joined with the profession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
in establishing his eminent position&mdash;whether he published with
his name or without it; or addressed his sentiments to his family,
unheard but in the sacred precincts of home,&mdash;we find his
thoughts and his language always the same. He had no dress
thoughts, no company mind-clothing; he was always the same,
simple, earnest, and sincere. In his very earliest papers, in his
lectures at College, or in those of the Hospital, we never entirely
lose sight of the golden thread to which I have before alluded.
The bulk of the discourse is always the question that is really
and properly before him; yet he seldom concludes the argument
philosophical, without glancing (and it is in that just keeping as
to be seldom more) at its ethical or its theological relations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
</div>


<blockquote>
<p>"It is the duty of Criticism neither to depreciate, nor dignify by partial
representations; but to hold out the light of reason, whatever it may discover."</p>

<p class="sigright in0"><span class="smcap">Johnson.</span></p>

<p>In tracing the progress of science, it is difficult to assign to
each individual his just share of merit. The evidence, always
incomplete, seldom allows us to do more than to mark the more
fortunate, to whom, as it were, the principal parts have been
allotted. The exposition of truth generally implies a previous
contest with error. This may, in one sense, be compared with
military achievements. We hear of the skill and wisdom of the
General and his associate Chiefs; but little is known of individual
prowess, on the multiplication of which, after all, the result
depends.</p>

<p>To one who conferred so many obligations on his country and
on mankind as Abernethy, it is difficult to assign only his just
share; and yet it is desirable that nothing be ascribed to him
which is doubtful or disputable.</p>

<p>Antecedently to Abernethy's time, and contemporaneous with
the date of Mr. Hunter's labours, surgery had, in the best hands,
and as a mere practical <i>art</i>, arrived at a respectable position;
still, in Abernethy's early day, barber-surgeons were not yet
extinct; and, as he jocosely phrased it, he himself had "doffed
his cap" to barber-surgeons. There is no doubt that some of
them had arrived at a very useful knowledge. The celebrated
Ambrose Paré was a French barber-surgeon. When Abernethy
entered into life, the best representative of the regular surgery
<i>of that day</i> was Mr. Pott, who was contemporary with the period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
of Mr. Hunter's labours. Mr. Pott was a good surgeon, an eloquent
lecturer, a scholar, and a gentleman; and he gave some
surgical lectures at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. We have perused
two manuscript copies of these lectures, which are in the
library of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society, and they
contain many useful and judicious observations. There are ripples
of a more humane and scientific surgery, and many parts that are
suggestive of onward study. Pott had also the good sense to
perceive the measured pretensions of his own time, and to predict
advances on it, as great as that itself was on the surgery of his
predecessors: but we do not perceive anything in Pott's lectures
in the shape of a science. <i>Extensive</i> generalizations we are not
thinking of; we have them <i>yet</i> to get; but we see nothing, in
the true sense of the word, even axiomatic. There are no steps,
no axioms, by which we can reach the platform of more general
propositions. In some of his operations, the most elementary
principles are either not perceived or neglected; and, although
there are general recognitions of the state of the health
influencing the so-called surgical maladies, there is no definite
principle developed. It is a recognition scarcely more than that
implied in the older surgical writers, when, if the surgical part of
a case did not go on well, they recommended the calling in of a
physician.</p>

<p>In this state of things, John Hunter began a beautifully
simple, and, in its bearings on surgery, we may add, a new mode
of inquiry. He saw that there was much in all animals that
was common, and that there were analogies in the whole
organic kingdom of nature; hence he sought to develop, by
observation of the various processes in various animals, and
their nearest analogies in vegetables also, the <i>true relations</i>
of the phenomena observable in man. It was not that he did
that which had never been attempted before, in the abstract,
but that he undertook it with a new, a concentrated unity of
purpose. He did not employ, as it were, a different instrument
to collect the rays of light from surrounding nature; but
he concentrated them into a focus on a different object&mdash;the
nature and treatment of disease. His labours, though not permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
to endure for many years, interrupted by indisposition,
and suddenly stopped by death, were abundantly fruitful; they
enabled him to simplify much of surgery that was officious and
hurtful, and to correct many errors. He first gave a reason for
this or that proceeding, founded on actual observation of natural
processes: thus, in healing of wounds, the natural and healthy
were distinguished from unnatural and unhealthy processes, and
so forth. But as Mr. Hunter's enlarged views taught him the
the value of the <i>relations</i> observable throughout the whole animal
creation, he contemplated <i>parts</i> of the body only as a step to the
more successful observation of the <i>whole</i>. As before stated, he
observed the phenomena exhibited by the various organs, both
separately and in connection; traced them with elaborate circumspection,
and concluded by justifying what Abernethy said, when
he observed: "Hunter proved that the whole body sympathized
with all its parts."</p>

<p>Now, many of the facts which Mr. Hunter remarked in the
relations established between different parts of the body, were, in
the strictest sense, axiomatic&mdash;that is, they were exemplifications
of laws to which they were the necessary steps. Take one for
example: that the part sympathetically affected by an impression
primarily made on another part, appeared to be frequently <i>more
disturbed</i> than the part with which it had appeared to sympathize.
This we now know to be no exception, but rather the law;
because the exceptions (as we contend<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor"><sup>82</sup></a>) are explicable; but
that was not then perceived. Abernethy, however, made use of
this so far as to impress the fact, that organs might be seriously
disordered without there being <i>apparently</i> any symptoms referable
to them.</p>

<p>Now, Abernethy might have continued to labour as Hunter
did in collecting facts as the materials for axioms, or as elements
for future and more extensive generalization; or he might have
at once taken Mr. Hunter's views, so far as he had gone, and,
working on them with his remarkable aptitude for perceiving the
more salient and practicable relations of facts, have applied them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
at once to practical purposes; gleaning more facts as his extremely
acute observation might have enabled him on the way. He
pursued, perhaps, neither course exclusively; but the latter appeared
to be the one he chiefly adopted; and, from the more
immediate fruition it affords, no doubt it was best adapted to the
existing exigencies of a practical profession.</p>

<p>John Hunter was a man of indefatigable industry, and exceedingly
<i>circumspect</i> in his observance of facts. Abernethy was
fagging too, but more impulsive and not so dogged; mere facts
were mere bores to him; he panted for <i>practical</i> relations, and
was most wonderfully quick in perceiving them. His vision was
as penetrative as Hunter's had been circumspect and cautious.
Hunter would have sifted all the useful things out of any heap,
however heterogeneous; Abernethy would have looked through it,
at once found the one jewel that it concealed, and left the rest for
the next comer. They were both most perfectly honest and
truthful, both careless of money, both enthusiastic in science&mdash;that
is, both ardent in the pursuit of truth, with that kind of
feeling which does not stop to examine the utilitarian relations of
these pursuits; but which, carried on by a continually increasing
impulse, takes the good for granted, and is impelled by the love
of truth for its own sake.</p>

<p>But, interesting as it is to contemplate those requisitions
which, as indispensable, are common to the successful investigators
of science, it is yet more so to observe the <i>distinctive</i> characters
of John Hunter and John Abernethy. The former, with many
ideas to tell, and most of them new, had a difficulty in expressing
himself. With more need than any man before him for additional
facilities in this way, he had a restricted vocabulary. Again, in
making use of it, his style was seldom easy, often obscure; so
that things which, when thoroughly understood, had no feature
more striking than their simplicity, were often made to appear
difficult, and by many readers, no doubt, had often been left unexamined.</p>

<p>Abernethy, on the contrary, had a happy facility of expressing
himself, and a power, rarely equalled, of singling out the difficult
parts of a subject, and simplifying them down to the level of ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
capacities. Hunter, though not without imagination, or
humour even, had these qualities held in abeyance by the unceasing
concentration of his intellectual faculty. As Abernethy used
to say, "John Hunter was always thinking." Abernethy, on
the contrary, had an active imagination; it always accompanied
his intellect, like a young, joyous attendant, constantly lighting
up the more sombre propositions of her grave companion with
varieties of illustration. The most difficult proposition, directly
Abernethy began to fashion it, had all its rough points taken off,
and its essential features brought out clear and orderly to the
plainest intellect. John Hunter, in laying down a series of facts
having the most important influence in the formation of a medical
science (take place when it may), was not able to keep people
awake. Abernethy's treatment of the most dry and unimportant,
kept his audience unceasingly interested. The obscurity of language
in Hunter was happily replaced, not only by an unusual
ease, but by a <i>curiosa felicitas</i>, in Abernethy. In sustained composition,
Hunter was generally difficult, often obscure; Abernethy,
if not faultless, always easy and unaffected. If his style
failed sometimes in earnestness and vigour, it was always sincere;
and whilst, though not deficient in eloquence, it asserted no special
claim to that excellence, it was always pleasing and perspicuous.</p>

<p>Nothing could be further from the earnest and thinking John
Hunter than anything dramatic. Abernethy had that happy
variety of countenance and manner that can be conveyed by no
other term. Hunter, without being slow, was cautious, circumspect:
Abernethy, without being hasty, was rapid, penetrative,
and impulsive. Never were two minds so admirably fitted for
the heavy-armed pioneering in science, and the comparatively
light-trooped intellect which was calculated to render the first
clearing easily convertible to those practical necessities with which
the science had to deal. Accordingly we find that Abernethy
very soon extended Mr. Hunter's views, and applied them so
powerfully, as at least to create the dawnings of a science. He
showed that all processes in the economy&mdash;and of course, therefore,
those of disease&mdash;are essentially nervous in their origin: that is
to say, the nerves being the <i>instruments</i> through which our relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
are established with surrounding nature (however much we
may, in common language, speak of this or that feeling, this or
that <i>organ</i>, or this or that part of the body), all impressions
must still be made primarily on the sensitive or nervous system
of that part; and this, of course, whether they imply <i>consciousness</i>,
or be altogether independent of it; that disturbed nervous
action was, as the case might be, either the forerunner&mdash;or the
next link in the chain of causation (i. e. the proximate cause)&mdash;of
the disease; and that therefore the relief of diseased or disordered
actions, however attempted, consisted ultimately and essentially
in the restoration of healthy nervous power, or adaptation.</p>

<p>This, then, is the first proposition. The next thing, and
which necessarily follows, is, that in the prevention or cure of
disease, the first object is the tranquillizing of nervous disorder.</p>

<p>Now, here there are many things to be regarded; for man is
a moral as well as a physical being; and the circumstances by
which he is surrounded, even the air he breathes, the moral and
physical impressions to which he is subjected, are very often not
under his own control, much less that of his medical attendant.
On the other hand, the food is, in civilized communities, very
much under the influence of his volition; and there are many
circumstances which, instead of impeding those adaptations which
disorder requires, renders them particularly easy&mdash;it frequently
happening that those things which are really best, are most easily
procured. This is important; because the next proposition is,
<i>that the nervous system is very easily and constantly disturbed by
disorder of one or other, or of the whole of the digestive organs</i>,
and that therefore the tranquillizing of disturbance in them is of
the highest consequence in the treatment of disease: <i>few</i> propositions
in <i>any</i> science are more susceptible of proof than the foregoing.
But if this be so, we must now recollect the full force of
what we have observed with regard to relation; that is, we must
not restrict our notion of it to the general loose assent that there
is a relation in all parts of the body, and rest on the simple admission,
for example, that animals are formed in adaptation to
their habits; but we must sustain the Cuvier-like impression of
the fact, the Owen-like application of it to the phenomena; recollect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
that <i>preconceived</i> ideas of magnitude and minuteness can
do nothing but obscure or mislead; and that the relations established
in the body are constant and universal, however they may
at first&mdash;as in the case we have quoted&mdash;excite the surprise or
the derision of the less informed and less reflecting. We must
take their immensely potential power as existing <i>as certainly in
the most trifling headache, as in the most malignant fever</i>&mdash;in the
smallest scratch, <i>as in the most complicated compound fracture</i>.
We have plenty of facts now to <i>prove</i> this; but the first plain,
clear enunciation of it all, the successful demonstration of it at
the bedside, and the consequent diminution of an enormous amount
of human suffering, is the great debt we owe to Abernethy. Mankind
in general admitted that Diet was of consequence. Nobody
doubted its force as an <i>accessory</i> in treatment. Lactantius said:
"Sis prudens ad victum sine quo cetera remedia frustra adhibentur."
But no one had recognized the treatment of the Digestive
Organs as the essential part of the treatment of <i>surgical</i>
diseases, nor founded it on the same comprehensive view of its
relations as addressed to organs which executed the nutritive
functions of the body on the one hand, and were the <i>most potential
disturbers or tranquillizers of the nervous system on the other</i>,
and thus for ever linked them in their practical relations with the
fact, that the essential element of disease, the <i>fons et origo</i>, is disturbed
nervous power. But, as all diseases are merely the result
of two conditions&mdash;namely, the injurious influence acting, and
the body acted on&mdash;it matters not whether the injurious influence
be sudden, violent, slow, moderate, chemical, mechanical, or what
not; so the foregoing positions affect the whole practice of medicine,
and must not be held as affecting any one part of it, but
as influencing equally both medicine and surgery.</p>

<p>We do trust that these few propositions will induce some to
think; for, as Abernethy used to say, lectures will never make
surgeons: and we feel equally confident that no books, no individual
efforts, however costly or sincere, will really benefit or inform
any portion of the public or the profession, except such of them
as may be induced to <i>think</i> for themselves. They have only to
recollect that, in carrying out such principles, they must not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
measure their influence by their previously conceived notions;
they must encourage labour when they see the profession willing,
and not thwart them by showing that it will be labour in vain.
There will soon be science, if it is encouraged:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sint Mæcenates, non deerunt Flacci</span>."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>If they are disposed to think investigation too minute to be
practical, or precision too unpleasant to be necessary, let them
remember the story of Professor Owen's beautiful application of
minute relation, and that the distinction between a huge common
quadruped and an unknown wingless bird could alone be discovered
by particulars far more minute than they will be called
on once in a hundred times to observe or to follow. The obligation
we have already noticed has in some sense revolutionized the
practice of medicine and surgery, and is no doubt the capital
debt we owe to Abernethy; but there are many others. His application
and adjustment of the operation of the trephine was a
beautiful and discriminating achievement, and would alone have
been sufficient to have raised an ordinary reputation.</p>

<p>His first extension of John Hunter's operation for aneurism,
shows how ready he was&mdash;when he could do so with advantage&mdash;to
enlarge the application of that branch of our duties which he
least valued&mdash;namely, operative surgery.</p>

<p>His proposal to add to the treatment of the diseases of joints
the apparatus of splints, for ensuring absolute quiescence of the
affected surfaces, has saved a most incalculable number of limbs
from amputation. It here becomes necessary to repeat a remark
we have made in a former work. Sir B. Brodie recommends this
plan only in the third edition, I think, of his discriminative work
on the joints, not appearing to have been aware that Abernethy
taught it for nearly thirty years previously, about ten years of
which we ourselves had repeatedly tested its great value, and
taught it, but contemporaneously from Abernethy, in our own
lectures. Indeed, so important an element is it in the treatment
of diseases of the joints, that we have never seen it fail, when
fairly applied and accompanied by a reasonable attention to the
general health, except in the following cases: First, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
patient has been nearly worn out by disease, before being subjected
to treatment; and, secondly, where the complaint has been
proved to be accompanied by internal organic disease.</p>

<p>We have always thought that one of the most valuable of our
obligations to Abernethy was his lesson on fracture of the neck
of the thigh bone within the capsule of the joint. For thirty
years, Sir Astley Cooper taught, and boasted that he had taught,
that this fracture could not unite by bone; Sir Astley reasoning
on the anatomy of the part <i>only</i>, and conceiving that the neck,
in its somewhat isolated position, would be imperfectly nourished;
and, seeing that, in point of fact, this fracture <i>did generally</i> unite
by ligament only, unfortunately adopted the foregoing idea as the
<i>cause</i> of the fact, and concluded that bony union was impracticable.
Experiments on animals&mdash;at all times extremely fallacious,
in this case singularly imperfect in the analogy they afforded&mdash;appeared
to confirm his views. Despairing of effecting a proper
union, he adopted a treatment which rendered it impossible.
Abernethy's beautiful reasoning on the subject led him to an
opposite conclusion. It embraced certain views of Hunter's, and
some common phenomena in other accidents where the union by
ligament is <i>coincident</i> with <i>motion</i> of the part. He therefore
treated all cases with a view to secure bony union; and he and
many of his pupils had no doubt but that they had seen examples
of its success. Still, people got well and were lost sight of, and
therefore it was said that the fracture was not <i>wholly</i> within the
capsule of the joint. At length a specimen was procured from
the examination of a dead body, and the question set at rest, we
believe, in the minds of every body, that this fracture, though it
require especial care to keep parts steady and in apposition, will
unite just like other fractures in the way taught (and since proved)
by Abernethy. Let those who can calculate the number of
surgeons who have been educated by these two gentlemen, and
who, for the first few years, would have almost certainly followed
the practice of their instructors, compute the number of those of
the lame who, under Providence, have walked in consequence of
the clear-sighted reasoning of Abernethy.</p>

<p>How the French surgeons may have been influenced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Abernethy on this subject, I do not know. When I was first in
Paris, in 1824, they were divided; but I recollect Baron Larrey
showing me a case which he regarded as a clear example of this
fracture in course of firm consolidation, and he was well aware of
the opinion of Abernethy.</p>

<p>The bearing which Abernethy's acuteness of observation of
the influence of the state of the digestive organs on so-called
specific poisons in producing or maintaining diseases resembling
them, opposed as it was to the most powerful conventionalism, is
a proof of his clear judgment; and, if we mistake not, will one
day prove to have been the first ripple of a most important law
in the animal economy, which will shed a light as new on specific
affections as his other principles have on diseases in general.</p>

<p>His treatment of that severe malady, "lumbar abscess," is, in
our view, a most acceptable addition to humane and successful
surgery; and as regards one of its distinctive characters, he has,
as we have shown, received the encomiums of the most distinguished
of his contemporaries, including Sir Astley Cooper.</p>

<p>The manner in which he applied that law which prevails in
voluntary muscles to the replacement of dislocations&mdash;namely,
that muscles under the influence of the will cannot ordinarily act
long and unremittingly&mdash;was an amendment as humane as scientific;
and, whilst it has removed from surgery a farrier-like
roughness in the treatment of dislocations, as repulsive as unnecessary,
it has adjusted the application of more sustained force,
when it becomes necessary, on principles at once humane, safe,
and effectual. In short, whatever part of surgery we consider,
we should have something to say of Abernethy&mdash;either something
new in itself, or improved in application. We find him equally
patient and discriminative, wherever there is danger; thus there
is the same force and originality on the occasional consequences
on the simple operation of bleeding in the arm, and the more
serious proceeding of perforating the cranium. He is every
where acute, penetrating, discriminative, humane, and practical;
so that it is difficult which most to admire, his enlarged views in
relation to important general principles, or the pervading science
and humanity with which he invests their minutest details.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span></p>

<p>Hunter's method of investigation was highly inductive; and,
whenever he adhered to it, the structure he has left is stable, and
fit for further superadditions. Whenever he proceeded on any
preconceived notions, or on an induction manifestly imperfect, his
conclusions have, as we think, been proved unsound. His definition
of disease, as distinct from accidental injury, is one instance
which we formerly noticed in our own works; and some of his
conclusions in regard to poisons&mdash;as mercury, for example&mdash;will
not hold; but all that Abernethy made use of, either in developing
his own views or maturing their practical applications, were
sound and most careful deductions from obvious and incontrovertible
facts. Abernethy took equal care to deduce nothing
from them, or from anything of his own observations, but the
most strictly logical inferences&mdash;conclusions which were, in truth,
little more than the expression of the facts, and therefore irrefragable.
He showed that, however dissimilar in kind, nervous
disturbance was the essential element of disease; and that the
removal of that disturbance was the essential element of cure.
That no mode should be neglected, therefore, which was capable
of exerting an influence on the nervous system; but that, whether
he looked at the subject as mere matter of fact, or as assisted
by the phenomena of health or disease generally, or merely to
that which was <i>most within our power</i>, no more potential disturbers
of the nervous system were to be found, than disordered
conditions of the digestive organs; and that the tranquillizing of
these must always be a leading object in our endeavours to achieve
the still greater one of tranquillizing nervous disorder.</p>

<p>The absurd idea that he looked chiefly to the stomach&mdash;that
he thought of nothing but blue pills or alterative doses of
mercury&mdash;need scarcely detain us. His works show, and his
lectures still more, that there was no organ in the body which
had not been the object of his special attention; in almost all cases,
in advance of his time; and not exceeded in practical value by
any thing now done. We know of nothing more valuable or
clear <i>now</i> than his paper on the skin; nothing so advanced or
important as his observations on the lungs and skin, and the
relations of these important organs; and it is unnecessary to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
repeat what has been already said about the digestive organs. His
medical treatment was always very simple, and, if its more salient
object was to correct disorders of the liver, it was because he
knew that the important relations of that organ not only
rendered it very frequently the cause of many disorders, but that
there could be nothing materially wrong in the animal economy,
by which it must not be more or less affected. He carried the
same clearness and definiteness of purpose into his prescriptions,
as that which characterized all his investigations; and, indisposed
to employ any means except on some principle, used but few
remedies; although he by no means wished to deter others from
having recourse to a more extended pharmacopæia. We regret,
indeed, the impossibility of doing full justice to Abernethy in
any thing less than a running commentary on the publication of
his works; but we have said enough, we trust, to show how
largely the profession and mankind are indebted to him.</p>

<p>Now, in these days of testimonials, what memorials have we
of Abernethy? It is true there is no monument at Westminster
Abbey, and only a bust at St. Bartholomew's. His portrait, to
be sure, given by his pupils, hangs at St. Bartholomew's, exalted
where it can hardly be distinctly seen, to be replaced by those of
Mr. Vincent<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor"><sup>83</sup></a>, and Mr. Lawrence in his Professor's gown! But he
has still a</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Monumentum ære perennius</span>,"</p>
</blockquote>


<p class="in0">in the claim he has established to the rarely so truly earned
honour of "nihil quod non tetigit, et nihil quod tetigit, quod non
ornavit;" in the grateful hearts of many a pupil who had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
other obligation to him than his beautiful lessons; and in an improved
medical Surgery, which, though it may have in <i>London</i>
rather retrograded than otherwise since his time, is felt more or
less in its moral as well as its medical bearings, and in a diminution
of suffering and an improved practice throughout the
civilized world.</p>

<p>But, if Abernethy's views are so true or so excellent as we
allege that they are, they must have <i>some</i> relation to anything
that is good in every kind of medical or surgical treatment; and
this equally, whatever the system (so called) whence it may arise,
however much of truth or error it may contain, or however perplexingly
these qualities may be blended together. These are
points on which we have yet something to say; and as we are anxious
that the public and the profession should favour us with their
attention to the very few remarks we have the space to offer, we
must have a new chapter.</p>

<p class="center bold in0 p1b">POSITION, PROGRESS, AND PROSPECTS OF THE PROFESSION&mdash;OF<br />
HYDROPATHY&mdash;OF HOMŒOPATHY&mdash;OF QUACKERY&mdash;OF PUBLIC<br />
IGNORANCE.</p>

<p>A writer<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor"><sup>84</sup></a>, of no ordinary judgment and discrimination, has
observed, that "it often happens in human affairs that the evil
and the remedy grow up at the same time: the remedy unnoticed,
and at a distance scarcely visible perhaps above the
earth; whilst the evil may shoot rapidly into strength, and
alone catch the eye of the observer by the immensity of its
shadow; and yet," he adds, "a future age may be able to mark
how the one declined and the other advanced, and how returning
spring seemed no longer to renew the honours of the one,
while it summoned into maturity and progress the perfection of
the other."</p>

<p>We know not how it may appear to the reader, but we cannot
help thinking that, in the foregoing sentence, there is a far-seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
perception of a very leading character in human affairs.
There is no evil but which is charged with a certain degree of
good. At first, it is indeed "scarcely visible"&mdash;nay, it escapes
alike the most penetrative perception and faithful confidence, in
the surpassing working-to-good of all things around us; but so
soon as the evil begins to tell&mdash;so soon as the full flood of mischief
becomes obtrusive or remarkable,&mdash;the small ripple of some
corrective principle rises into view.</p>

<p>It would be easy to illustrate the foregoing proposition from
general history, from the progress of nations, or even from the
contracted area of individual experience. But we will confine
ourselves to an illustration more directly in relation to our immediate
object&mdash;namely, the present condition and prospects of
medical science.</p>

<p>There are, no doubt, many persons who view the present state
of Medical Science as little better than the triumphant domination
of a conjectural art, which has long obscured, and is still
very imperfectly representing, a beautiful science; and that the
perception of the true relations which it bears to such science
has been veiled by the impression that it involved some mystery
from which the general public, who were most interested in its
development, were necessarily excluded.</p>

<p>There have been at all times individuals, perhaps, sufficiently
astute to see the real truth of the matter; but still they were
rare exceptions, and did not prevent Mystery from conferring, on
a very considerable section of people, the social advantage of a
gainful profession; that property being enhanced, of course, in
that it ministered to an ignorant public. But, even in an early
stage, correctives to an equivocally-earned advantage began to
appear; for a thing which had no character but its indefiniteness,
and its apparent facility of acquisition, obtained many followers:
the supply, such as it was, was thus so close in relation to the
demand, that what in theory seemed necessarily very gainful, in
practice, on the whole, proved anything but a lucrative profession.
As contrasted with any other, or a variety of commercial pursuits,
medical men were neither so affluent, nor always so secure of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
position. Retiring competency in well-conducted callings has, in
a rich country, been rather the rule. We fear, in the medical
profession it is the exception; which, we are apprehensive (in its
bereaved dependents), contributes more applicants for eleemosynary
relief than any other.</p>

<p>This surely is not a state of things which can be well made
worse. Public ignorance, the <i>real mischief</i>, has, in the meantime,
been left uninformed; and any attempt to enlighten it has
too often been branded with some kind or other of corrupt
motive. Public positions have been conferred without competition&mdash;the
surest test of fitness or excellence; and the public have
been further doubly barred out, in that the chance of eliciting
men of spirit and enthusiasm has been diminished, by the first
positions having been often rendered contingent on the payment
of money in the right quarter.</p>

<p>But all this time corrections were slowly springing up.
Hundreds were beginning, under the light of a more liberal
diffusion of general knowledge, to feel that the so-called Science
of medicine and surgery was very different from science usually
so termed; and, whilst other sciences were affording that which
was definite and positive, the juxtaposition only seemed to bring
out in higher relief the prevailing character of conjecture and
uncertainty in medicine.</p>

<p>People began to see that, in mere human occupation, mystery
is but mystery, to whatever it is applied; and that one man can
see in the dark about as well as another; that, where all is
obscure, any one may scramble with a chance of success. Accordingly,
we observe that a state of things has gradually been
rising up, which, if it do not justify the expression of <i>quot medici
tot empirici</i>, at least leads us to deplore that, of all callings in
life, no one had ever such a legion of parasites as are represented
by the hydra-headed quackeries which infest the medical profession.
Naturally enough, too, Quackery attacked chiefly those
disorders in regard to which Mystery avowed its incapacity, or
declared to be incurable; and thus, while the regular profession
made their <i>own limited</i> knowledge the measures of the <i>powers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
nature</i>, the quacks unconsciously proceeded, <i>de facto</i>, more philosophically,
when they neither avowed nor acknowledged any other
limits than those of observation and experience.</p>

<p>Amongst, no doubt, innumerable failures, and, as we know, a
multiplicity of fictions, they would now and then, in acting
violently on the various organs, blunder on the last link in the
chain&mdash;the immediate cause of the disorder; and perhaps effect
the removal of a so-called incurable malady. Thus, whilst the
regular profession were making their own knowledge the <i>measure</i>
of remedial possibility, and were reposing contentedly on the
rule, they were every now and then undermined, or tripped up,
by unexplained exceptions.</p>

<p>It is difficult to conceive any state of things, when once
observed, more calculated to drive men to the obvious remedy
that a definite science would alone afford; nor should it be forgotten
that multiform quackeries, with mesmerism to boot, are
coincident with a system which allows <i>not one single appointment</i>,
which the public are requested to regard as implying authority,
to be open to scientific competition. Of late, many persons have
begun to examine for themselves questions which they had been
wont to leave entirely to their medical adviser.</p>

<p>The sanitary movement has shown that more people die
every year from avoidable causes than would satisfy the yawning
gulf of a severe epidemic, or the most destructive battle. In a
crowded community, many events are daily impressing on the
heads of families, besides the expedience of avoiding unnecessary
expenses, that long illnesses are long evils; that their dearest
connections are sometimes prematurely broken; and that parts
are not unfrequently found diseased which are not suspected to
be so during life. The thought will sometimes occur whether this
may have been always consequent on the <i>difficulty</i> of the subject,
or whether it may not have been sometimes the result of <i>too hasty
or too restricted</i> an inquiry; that not only (as the Spanish tutor
told his royal pupil of kings) do patients die "sometimes," but
very frequently.</p>

<p>These and other circumstances have induced many of the
public to inquire into the reason of their faith in us; and to ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
how it happens that, whilst all other sciences are popularized and
progressing, there should be any thing so recondite in the laws
governing our own bodies as to be accessible only to comparatively
few; especially as they have begun to perceive that their
interests, in knowing such laws, is of the greatest possible importance.</p>

<p>Amongst various attempts to better this condition of things,
the imagination of men has been very active. Too proud to
obey the guidance, or too impatient to await the fruition, of those
cautious rules which the intellect has imposed on the one hand,
and which have been so signally rewarded (whenever observed)
on the other, imagination has set forth on airy wing, and
brought home curiosities which she called science, and observations
which, because they contained <i>some</i> of that truth of which
even fancies are seldom entirely deprived, blinded her to the perception
of a much larger portion of error.</p>

<p>Two of these curiosities have made considerable noise, have
been not a little damaging to the pecuniary interests of the medical
profession, and have been proportionately species of El Dorados
to the followers of them. We allude to the so-called Homœopathy
and Hydropathy.</p>

<p>Homœopathy proceeds on an axiom that diseases are cured by
remedies which excite an action similar to that of the disease
itself; "<i>Similia similibus curantur</i>."</p>

<p>Our objection to this dogma is twofold, and, in the few hints
we are giving, we wish them not to be confounded.</p>

<p>1st. It is <i>not</i> proven.</p>

<p>2nd. It is <i>not</i> true.</p>

<p>Take the so-called fever. The immediate and most frequent
causes of fever are bad air, unwholesome food, mental inquietude,
derangement of the digestive organs, severe injuries. Now it is
notorious that very important agents in the cure of all fevers
are good air, carefully exact diet or temporary abstinence, and
correction of disordered functions, with utmost repose of mind
and body, and so forth.</p>

<p>So of small-pox, one of the most instructive of all diseases.
All the things favourable to small-pox are entirely opposite to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
those which conduct the patient safely through this alarming
disease; and so clearly is this the case, that, if known beforehand,
its virulence can be indefinitely moderated, so as to become
a comparatively innoxious malady.</p>

<p>We might go on multiplying these illustrations to almost any
extent. What, then, is the meaning of the <i>similia similibus
curantur</i>? This we will endeavour, so far as there is any truth
in it, to explain. The truth is, that Nature has but one mode,
principle, or law, in dealing with injurious influences on the body.
Before we offer the few hints we propose to do on these subjects
(and we can here do no more), we entirely repudiate that sort of
abusive tone which is too generally adopted. That never can do
anybody any good. We believe both systems to be dangerous
fallacies; but, like all other things, not allowed to be entirely
uncharged with good. We shall state, as popularly as possible,
in what respect we deem them to be dangerous fallacies, and in
what we deem them to be capable of effecting some good; because
it is our object to show, in respect to both, that the good they do
is because they accidentally, as it were, chip off a small corner of
the principles of Abernethy.</p>

<p>Homœopathy is one of those hypotheses which show the
power that a minute portion of truth has to give currency to a
large quantity of error; and how much more powerful in the uninformed
are appeals to the imagination than to the intellect.
The times are favourable to homœopathy. To some persons, who
had accustomed themselves to associate medical attendance with
short visits, long bills,&mdash;a gentleman in black, all smiles,&mdash;and a
numerous array of red bottles, homœopathy must have addressed
itself very acceptably. It could not but be welcome to hear that
all the above not very pleasing impressions could be at once dismissed
by simply swallowing the decillionth part of a grain of
some efficacious drug. Then there was the prepossession so
common in favour of mystery. How wonderful! So small a
quantity! What a powerful medicine it must be! It was as
good as the fortune-telling of the gipsies. There! take that,
and then you will see what will happen next! Then, to get
released from red bottles tied over with blue or red paper, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
if they were not infinitesimal in dose, had appeared infinite in
number, to say nothing of the wholesome repulsion of the palate.</p>

<p>Besides, after the bottles, came the bill, having no doubt the
abominable character of all bills, which, by some law analogous
to gravitation, appear to enlarge in a terrifically accelerating ratio,
in proportion to their longevity; so that they fall at last with an
unexpected and a very unwelcome gravity. Then homœopathy
did not restrict itself to infinitesimal doses of medicine, but
recommended people to live plainly, to relinquish strong drinks,
and, in short, to adopt what at least seemed an approximation to
a simple mode of living. To be serious&mdash;what, then, are the
objections to homœpathy?</p>

<p>Is there no truth, then, in the dogma, "<i>Similia similibus
curantur</i>?" We will explain. The <i>laws</i> governing the human
body have an established mode of dealing with all injurious influences,
which is identical in principle, but infinitely varied and
obscured in its <i>manifestations</i>, in consequence of multifarious
<i>interferences</i>; in that respect, just like the laws of light or of
gravitation. As we have no opportunity of going into the subject
at length, we will give a hint or two which will enable the
observing, with a moderate degree of painstaking, to see the
fallacy. You can <i>demonstrate</i> no fallacy in a mathematical process
even, without some work; neither can you do so in any
science; so let that absence of complete demonstration be no bar
to the <i>investigation</i> of the hints we give. All medicines are
more or less poisons; that is, they have no nutritive properties,
or these are so overbalanced by those which are injurious, that
the economy immediately institutes endeavours for their expulsion,
or for the relief of the disturbance they excite. All organs
have a special function of their own, but all can on occasions
execute those of some other organ. So, in carrying out injurious
influences, organs have peculiar relations to different forms of
matter; that is, <i>ordinarily</i>. Thus, the stomach is impatient of
ipecacuanha, and substances which we call emetics; the liver, of
mercury, alcohol, fat, and saccharine matters; and so forth. In
the same way we might excite examples of other organs which
ordinarily deal with particular natural substances. But then, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
the compensating power they have, they <i>can</i> deal with any substance
on special occasions.</p>

<p>Now the natural mode in which all organs deal with injurious
substances, or substances which tend to disturb them, is by pouring
forth their respective secretions; but if, when stimulated,
they have not the power to do that, then they evince, as the case
may be, disorder or disease. Thus, for example: If we desire to
influence the secretion from the liver, mercury is one of <i>the many
things</i> which will do it. But if mercury cease to do this, it will
produce disease; and, if carried to a certain extent, of no organ
<i>more certainly</i> than the liver. Thus, again, alcohol, in certain
forms, is a very useful medicine for the liver; yet nothing, in continuance,
more notoriously produces disease of that organ. So
that it happens that all things, which in one form disorder an
organ, <i>may</i>, in another form, in greater or more continued doses,
tend to correct that disorder, by inducing there a greater, and
thus exciting stimulation of its secretions.</p>

<p>This is the old dogma, long before homœopathy was heard of,
of one poison driving out another. This is the way in which fat
bacon, at one period, or in one case, may be a temporary or a
good stimulant of a liver which it equally disorders in another;
for as the liver is a decarbonizing agent, as well as the lungs, so
articles rich in carbon are all stimulants of that organ; useful,
<i>exceptionally</i>; invariably disordering, if <i>habitual</i> or <i>excessive</i>.</p>

<p>But if this be so, what becomes of the "<i>curantur</i>?" To that,
we say it is far from proven. Medicine hardly ever&mdash;perhaps
never, <i>strictly speaking</i>&mdash;cures; but it often materially assists in
putting people in a <i>curable condition</i>, proper for the agencies of
more natural influences. True. Well, then, may not homœopathy
be good here? We doubt it; and for this reason: Medicine,
to do good, should <i>act</i> on the organ to which it is directed;
it is itself essentially a poison, and does well to relieve organs by
which <i>it is expelled</i>; but if you give medicine in very small doses,
or so as to institute an artificial condition of <i>those sentinels</i>, the
nerves, you may <i>accumulate a fearful amount of injurious influence
in the system before you are at all aware of it</i>. And it is
the more necessary to be aware of this in respect to homœopathy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
because many of the medicines which homœopathists employ are
active poisons; as belladonna, aconite, and so on. We have
seen disturbed states of nerves, bordering on paralysis, which
were completely unintelligible, until we found that the patient
had been taking small doses of narcotic poisons. We have no
desire whatever to forestall the cool decisions of experience; but
we earnestly request the attention of the homœopathist to the
foregoing remarks; and, if he thinks there is anything in them,
to peruse the arguments on which we found the law of which we
have formerly spoken<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor"><sup>85</sup></a>.</p>

<p>We must in candour admit that, as far as the inquiry into all
the facts of the case go, as laid down by Hahnemann, we think
the profession may take a hint with advantage. We have long
pleaded for more accuracy in this respect; but we fear, as yet,
pleaded in vain. Homœopathic influences may be perhaps more
successful. Practically, the good that results from homœopathy,
as it appears to us, may be thus stated: that if people will leave
off drinking alcohol, live plainly, and take very little medicine,
they will find that many disorders will be relieved by this treatment
alone.</p>

<p>For the rest, we fear that the so-called small doses are either
inert, or, if persisted in so as to produce effect, that they incur
the risk of accumulating in the system influences injurious to the
economy; which the histories of mercury, arsenic, and other
poisons, show to be nothing uncommon: and, further, that this
tends to keep out of sight the real uses and the <i>measured influences</i>
of medicine, which, in the ordinary practice, their usual
effects serve, as the case may be, to suggest or demonstrate.</p>

<p>Practically, therefore, the effects of homœopathy resolve
themselves, so far as they are good, into a more or less careful
diet, and small doses of medicine; which, as we have said, is a
chipping off of the views of Abernethy.</p>

<p>We regret we have no space to consider the relation of homœopathy
to serious and acute diseases. We can therefore only say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
that the facts which have come before us have left no doubts on
our minds of its being alike dangerous and inapplicable.</p>

<hr class="style1" />

<p>One morning, a nobleman asked his surgeon (who was representing
to him the uselessness of consulting a medical man without
obeying his injunctions) what he thought would be the effect
of his going into a hydropathic establishment? "That you would
get perfectly well," was the reply; "for there your lordship
would get plain diet and good air, and, as I am informed, good
hours; in short, the very things I recommend to you, but which
you will not adopt with any regularity."</p>

<p>Hydropathy sets out, indeed, with water as its staple, and the
skin as the organ to which it chiefly addresses itself; but we
imagine that the hydropathic physician, if he sees nothing in philosophical
medicine, discovers sufficient in human nature, to prevent
him from trading on so slender a capital. There was, no
doubt, in the imperfection of medical science, a fine opening left
for a scheme which proposed to rest its merits chiefly on an organ
so much neglected.</p>

<p>There has never been anything bordering on a proper attention
to the skin, until recently; and even now, any care commensurate
with the importance of the organ, is the exception rather
than the rule. Thirty years ago, Abernethy, when asked by a
gentleman as to the probable success of a bathing establishment,
said that the profession would not be persuaded to attend to the
subject; and that, in respect to the capital which the gentleman proposed
to invest in it, he had better keep the money in his pocket.
This was said in relation to the general importance of attention
to the skin, and also in connection with making it the portal for
the introduction of medical agents generally. Abernethy was, in
fact, the first who introduced into this country Lalonette's method
of affecting the system by mercury applied to the skin in vapour.</p>

<p>Hydropathy deals with a very potent agent, and applies it to
a very powerful and important organ, the skin; and it employs
in combination the energetic influences, temperature and moisture;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
so that we may be assured there will be very little that is equivocal
or infinitesimal in <i>its</i> results; that in almost every case it
must do good or harm.</p>

<p>But it does not limit itself to these agencies. It has "establishments;"
that is to say, pleasant rural retreats, tastefully
laid-out gardens; plain diet; often, no doubt, agreeable society;
rational amusements; and, as we understand, good hours, with
abstinence from alcohol. These are, indeed, powerful agencies in
a vast variety of diseases. So that, if hydropathy be not very
scientific, it is certainly a clever scheme; and as there are very
many people who require nothing but good air, plain living, rest
from their anxious occupations, with agreeable society,&mdash;it is very
possible that many hydropathic patients get well, by just doing
that which they could not be induced to do before.</p>

<p>But here comes the objection: The skin is, in the first
place, only <i>one</i> of the organs of the body, and it is in very different
conditions in different people, and in the same people at different
periods.</p>

<p>It has, like other organs, its mode of dealing with powerful
or with injurious influences; and <i>if it deal with them</i> in the full
force of the natural law, it affects (and, in disease, almost uniformly)
favourably the internal organs; but, on the other hand,
<i>if there be interfering influences opposed to the healthy</i> exhibition
of the natural law, so that the skin do not deal with the cold, or
other agencies, to which it is subjected, <i>as it naturally should do</i>,
then the cold, moisture, or other agent, increases the determination
of the blood to the internal organs, and does mischief. This
it may do in one of two ways: we have seen both. 1st. The
blood driven from the surface, increases, <i>pro tanto</i>, the quantity
in the internal organs: it must go somewhere; it can go nowhere
else. Or, if cold and moisture produce not this effect, nor
be attended with a reactive determination to the surface, there
may be an <i>imperfect</i> reaction; that is, <i>short</i> of the surface of the
body. In the first case, you dangerously increase the disorder of
any materially affected organ; in the latter, you incur the risk
of diseased depositions; as, for example, Tumours. We here
speak from our own experience, having seen tumours of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
malignant and cancerous character developed under circumstances
in which it appeared impossible to ascribe the immediate cause to
anything but the violently depressing influence of hydropathic
treatment on the skin, with a co-existing disordered condition of
internal organs.</p>

<p>In one very frightful case indeed, the patient was told, when
he first stated his alarm, that the tumour was a "crisis" or reaction;
as sure enough it was; but it was the reaction of a cancerous
disease, which destroyed the patient. But, as we have
said, hydropathy has many features which obviously minister very
agreeably and advantageously to various conditions of indisposition,
whilst they favour the <i>bonâ fide observance</i> of something like
a rational diet&mdash;a point of immense consequence, and too much
neglected in regular practice. Here again we speak from actual
observation. One man allows his patient to eat what he pleases.
An eminent physician replied to a patient who, as he was leaving
the room, asked what he should do about his diet, "Oh, I leave
that to yourself;" showing, as we think, a better knowledge
of human nature than of his profession. Another restricts his
patient to "anything light." Others see no harm in patients
eating three or four things at dinner, "provided they are wholesome;"
thus rendering the solution of many a question in serious
cases three or four times, of course, as difficult. Now we do not
require the elaborate apparatus of a hydropathic establishment to
cure disorders, after such loose practice as this; and we do protest
against the assertion that any such treatment can be called,
as we have sometimes heard it, "Abernethy's plan, attention to
diet," and so forth.</p>

<p>So far from anything <i>less</i> than the beautifully simple views
held out by Abernethy being necessary, we trust that we have,
some of us, arrived, as we ought to do, at several improvements.
But people will confound a <i>plain</i> diet, or a select diet, with a
<i>starving</i> diet, and, hating restrictions altogether, naturally prefer
a physician who is good-natured and assenting; still this assentation
is being visited, we think, with a justly retributive reaction.</p>

<p>Hydropathy, in many points, no doubt, tends to excite attention
to the real desiderata; but it is nevertheless imperfect and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
dangerous, because evidently charged with a capital error. It entirely
fails in that comprehensive view of the relations which exists in all
animals between the various organs; and on a sustained recollection
and examination of which, rests the safe treatment of <i>any
one</i> of them. It is, therefore, unsafe and unscientific. Again, it is
illogical, because it proceeds, as regard the skin, on the suppressed
premise, that it will obtain a natural reaction; a thing, in a very
large number of cases, and those of the most serious kind, seldom
to be calculated on.</p>

<p>It is quite clear, therefore, that, so far as hydropathy does
good, it effects it by the institution of diet, abstinence from
alcohol, country air, exercise, agreeable society, and, <i>we</i> will
suppose, in some cases, appropriate care of the surface; all of
which are, in a general sense, beneficial to the nervous system and
the digestive organs&mdash;the points insisted on by Abernethy.</p>

<p>So long as the Public are not better informed, and until
medicine is more strictly cultivated as a science, they will necessarily
be governed by the first impression on their feelings; and
so long as this is the case, fallacies can never be exposed, except
by the severe lessons of experience. To hope to reason successfully
with those whose feelings induce them to adopt that which
they decline to examine with their intellect, is madness, and is
just what Terence says of some other feelings:</p>


<div lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i12">"Nihilo plus agas</div>
<div class="i0">Quam si des operam ut cum ratione insanias."</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>But, although, therefore, we are neither hydropathists nor
homœopathists, we begin to see, in the very success of these
things, some good; and that the "great shadow of the evil" of
a conjectural science will one day be replaced by another example
of the triumph of an inductive philosophy; that the retiring confidence
of the public will induce in us a more earnest and successful
effort to give them a more definite science; and that, as
Professor Smythe says, the "returning spring will no longer
renew the honours of the one," whilst it will gradually evolve the
development of the other.</p>

<p>The efforts, too, which the profession are already making,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
though, as we humbly consider, not in the right direction, will
certainly arrive in time at a path that is more auspicious. When
we see the hydropathist looking so much to the skin, homœopathy
leading people to think of <i>quantities</i> of medicine; when,
in the regular profession, we see one man restricting his views to
one organ, another to another, a third thinking that <i>everything</i>
can be learnt only by examination of the dead, thus confounding
morbid anatomy with pathology&mdash;a fourth <i>restricting</i> his labours
to the microscope, as if the discovery of laws depended rather on
the enlargement of sensual objects than on the improvement of
<i>intellectual</i> vision; still we cannot but perceive that these isolated
labours, if <i>once concentrated by unity of purpose and combined
action</i>, would be shadowing forth the outline of a really inductive
inquiry.</p>

<p>Hydropathy and homœopathy are making powerful uses, too,
of the <i>argumenta ad crumenam</i>. Their professors are amassing
very large sums of money, and that is an influence which will in
time probably generate exertions in favour of a more definite
science. Still, Medicine and Surgery cannot be formed into a
science so long as men consider it impossible; nor can there be
any material advance, if they will persist in measuring the
remedial processes of nature by their present power of educing
them&mdash;a presumption obviously infinitely greater than any in
which the veriest quack ever dared to indulge. Well did Lord
Bacon see the real difficulties of establishing the dominion of an
inductive philosophy, when he laboured so much in the first place
to destroy the influence of preconceived opinions&mdash;idols, as he
justly called them.</p>

<p>You cannot, of course, write truth on a page already filled
with conjecture. Nevertheless, mankind seem gradually exhausting
the resources of Error: many of her paths have been trodden,
and their misleading lures discovered; and by and by that of
Truth will be well-nigh the only one left untried. In the meantime,
we fear the science is nearly good enough for the age. The
difficulty of advance is founded deeply in the principles of human
nature. People know that there are physical laws as well as moral
laws, and they may rely on it that disobedience and disease, sin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
and death, are as indissolubly bound up with infractions of the
one as well as the other.</p>

<p>It is true there are many who have (however unconsciously)
discovered that the pleasures procured by the abuses of our appetites,
are a cheat; and that permanent good is only attained by
obeying those laws which were clearly made for our happiness.</p>

<p>Error has, indeed, long darkened the horizon of medical
science; and, albeit, there have been lightning&mdash;like coruscations
of genius&mdash;from time to time; still they have passed away, and
left the atmosphere as dark as before. At length, however, there
has arisen, we hope, a small, but steady, light, which is gradually
diffusing itself through the mists of Error; and which, when it
shall have gained a very little more power, it will succeed in
dispelling.</p>

<p>Then, we trust, Medicine will be seen in the graceful form in
which she exists in nature; as a Science which will enable us to
administer the physical laws in harmony with that moral code
over which her elder sister presides; but, whenever this shall
happen, Surgery will recognize, as the earliest gleams of light
shed on her paths of inquiry, in aid of the progress of science
and the welfare of mankind, the honoured contributions of John
Hunter and John Abernethy.</p>

<p>We have already observed that Abernethy had begun to feel
the wear and tear of an anxious and active life, when, after a
tenure of office for twenty-eight years as assistant, he was appointed
surgeon to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. After a few
years, he took a house at Enfield, where he occasionally went at
leisure hours, on Wednesday and Saturday; and, as the Spring
Course of Lectures came near to a conclusion, and in the summer,
sometimes on other afternoons. At this season, he had been
accustomed to doff the black knee-breeches, silk stockings, and
shoes, sometimes with, sometimes without, short gaiters, and
refresh one's rural recollections with drab kerseymeres and top-boots;
in which costume he would at that season not unfrequently
come down to lecture. He was fond of riding, and had a
favourite mare he called Jenny; and many a time have we seen
her jogging along on a fine summer afternoon, and her master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
looking as happy as any schoolboy that he was escaping from the
botherations of Bedford Row and the smoke of London. Jenny
was a favourite mare, which Abernethy had for nearly twenty-five
years. She was a great pet, and her excellent qualities had been
associated with almost every little excursion of relaxation or
pleasure. All things, however, must have an end. At last, the
poor animal became affected with a kind of rheumatism, attended
with much suffering. After various hesitations, the pain of which
those who are fond of animals can very well understand, the order
was given that she should be destroyed. This took place in the
stables behind Bedford Row. The family were all in one apartment,
except Mr. Abernethy, who was heard pacing up and down his
private room. A short pause, and the coachman is seen running
from the stable to say that Jenny was no more. One of his
daughters ran to Mr. Abernethy's room to say, "it is all over,
papa." "Good girl," said he, patting her head, "to come and
tell me so soon." He is said to have suffered greatly on this
occasion.</p>

<p>Some years before this, he met with what might have been a
serious accident: in stooping forward, his horse threw up his
head and struck him a violent blow on the forehead and nose; as
Mr. Abernethy first thought, breaking the bones of the latter.
He rode up a gateway, and, having dismounted, was endeavouring
to adjust the bruise and staunch the blood, when some people
ran to assist him, and, as he said, very kindly asked him if they
should fetch him a doctor; "but," said Abernethy, "I told them
I thought they had better fetch me a hackney coach," which
they accordingly did. He was conveyed home, and in a short
time recovered from the accident.</p>

<p>His taking the house at Enfield was probably a prudent
measure; he seemed to enjoy it very much, and especially in
getting a quiet friend or two down on a Saturday to stay over till
the Monday; amongst whom, a very favourite visitor was our
respected friend Mr. Clift, of whom we have already spoken.
Abernethy had always, however, had what he used aptly enough
to term a fidgetty nervous system. From early life he had been
annoyed by a particularly irritable heart. The first time he ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
suffered materially from it was while he was yet a young man.
He had been exceedingly depressed by the death of a patient in
whose case he had been much interested, and his heart became
alarmingly violent and disordered in its action. He could not
sleep at night, and sometimes in the day it would beat so violently
as to shake his waistcoat. He was afterwards subject to fugitive
returns of this complaint, and few, unless by experience, know
how distressing such attacks are.</p>

<p>We suspect that surgeons are more frequently thus affected than
is generally supposed. A cold, half-brutal indifference is one thing,
but a calm and humane self-possession in many of our duties is
another, and, as we saw in Cheselden, not obtained always without
some cost; the effects of this sometimes appear only when the causes
have ceased to recur, or are forgotten. A lively sensibility to impressions
was natural to Abernethy; but this susceptibility had been
increased by the well-known influence of the air and excitement
of crowded cities on people who are engaged in much mental
exertion. His physical organization, easily susceptible of disturbance,
did not always shake it off again very readily. At one
period he suffered an unusually long time from the consequences
of a wound in dissection.</p>

<p>These not uncommon accidents occur perhaps a hundred or a
thousand times without being followed by any material results;
but, if they happen in disordered conditions of health, either of
mind or body, they are sometimes serious affairs, and usually of a
more or less active kind&mdash;that is, soon terminating in death or
recovery. Not so in Abernethy. The complaint went through
various phases, so that it was nearly three years, he used to tell
us, before he fairly and finally got rid of the effects of it. One
of the most difficult things for a man so actively engaged in a
profession in London as was Abernethy, is to get the requisite
quantity of exercise; whilst the great mental exertion which
characterizes a London, as distinguished from almost any other
kind of life, requires that the digestive organs should be "up to"
pretty good living.</p>

<p>Then, again, Abernethy lived in the days of port wine; when
every man had something to say of the sample his hospitality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
produced of that popular beverage. Abernethy, who was never
intemperate, was very hospitable, and always selected the finest
port wine he could get, which, as being generally full and powerful,
was for him perhaps the least fitted.</p>

<p>Mr. Lloyd, of Fleet Street, who was one of the old-fashioned
family wine-merchants, and one of the best men of his day, was
the purveyor of his Falernian; never was there a more correct
application of nomenclature than that which gave to him the
title, by which he was best known, of "Honest John Lloyd."
He was one of the kindest-hearted men I ever knew: he had a
great regard for Mr. Abernethy; and was treated himself by
almost everybody as an intimate friend. One day I went there
just as Abernethy had left. "Well," says Mr. Lloyd, "what a
funny man your master is!" "Who?" said I. "Why, Mr.
Abernethy. He has just been here, and paid me for a pipe of
wine; and threw down a handful of notes and pieces of papers
with fees. I wanted him to stop to see if they were right,
'for,' said I, 'some of these fees may be more than you think,
perhaps.' 'Never mind,' said he; 'I can't stop; you have
them as I took them,' and hastily went his way."</p>

<p>Sedentary habits, however, as people now begin to find, do
not harmonize well with great mental exertion, or constant and
anxious occupation. In 1817, Abernethy felt his combined
duties as surgeon to the hospital, as lecturer there, and also at
the College, becoming too onerous, and therefore in that year
resigned the Professorship. On this occasion, the Council sent
him the following unanimous expression of their appreciation of
his services.</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="sigright in0">"At the Court of Assistants of the Royal College of Surgeons in<br />
London, holden at the College on the 15th day of July, 1817;</p>

<p class="sigleft in0">"Resolved unanimously:</p>

<p>"That the thanks of this Court be presented to John
Abernethy, Esq. for the series of Lectures delivered by him in
the theatre of this College, in the years 1814, 1815, 1816,
1817, with distinguished energy and perspicuity, by which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
has elucidated the physiological and pathological opinions of
John Hunter, explained his design in the formation of the
Hunterian Collection, illustrated the principles of surgery, and
thereby has highly conduced to the improvement of anatomical
and physiological knowledge, the art and science of surgery,
and to the promotion of the honour of the College."</p></blockquote>

<p>This seems to have gratified him, as, under all circumstances,
we can readily understand it might do; and he accordingly
replied to it as follows:</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="center in0">"TO THE MASTER, GOVERNORS, AND COUNCIL OF THE ROYAL<br />
COLLEGE OF SURGEONS.</p>

<p class="sigleft in0">"Sir and Gentlemen,</p>

<p>"To obtain the good opinion of others, is a universal object
of human actions; and we often strive to acquire it by circuitous
and absurd means; but to obtain the approbation of
eminent and judicious characters, by pursuing the direct path
of professional duty, is the most gratifying mode of seeking
and receiving this object of general ambition.</p>

<p>"I have ventured to premise these observations, to show you,
gentlemen, that I do not write inconsiderately, or merely as a
matter of form, when I thus return you my warmest thanks for
the distinguished honour you have conferred on me by your
public approbation of my <i>endeavours</i><a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor"><sup>86</sup></a> to discharge the duties
of an arduous office, to which I was elected through your
kindness and confidence.</p>

<p class="sigright in0">"I have the honour to remain,&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;<br />
"Sir and Gentlemen,&#8195;&#8195;<br />
"Your very grateful and obedient servant,&#8195;<br />
"<span class="smcap">John Abernethy</span>."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>We insert in this place a letter which he wrote about this
time to Sir William Blizard; because it shows two things which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
are characteristic: the one, how constant he was in not allowing
any considerations to interfere with the lectures; and the other,
the endurance of his old attachment to Sir William Blizard. It
is an apology for not having been present at the Council.</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="sigleft in0">"Dear Sir William,</p>

<p>"I was yesterday desired to see a patient residing seven or
eight miles from London. I could not go that day, for it was
lecture evening; I cannot go to-morrow for the same reason;
consequently I must go this evening. I hope you will consider
these circumstances as an apology for my <i>absence</i> from the
Board.</p>

<p>"If you cite my example as one misleading future Professors,
be so good as to remember that I retired, leaving the task
which I had undertaken incomplete, wherefore it became necessary
to <i>explain publicly</i> to an indulgent audience my <i>motives</i>
for resigning the Professorship.</p>

<p class="sigright in0">"I remain, dear Sir William,&#8195;&#8195;<br />
"Yours unremittingly,&#8195;<br />
"<span class="smcap">John Abernethy</span>."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Abernethy had at various periods of his life been subject to
an inflammatory sore throat of a very active kind, which would
on some days impede so as almost to prevent his swallowing, and
then suddenly terminate in abscess, leaving him perfectly well
again. He was young when these sorts of attack began; for in
his lectures he used to speak of one of them having subsided
only the night before he had some lectures to deliver before the
Council of the College, when they were accustomed to meet in
the Old Bailey.</p>

<p>As he advanced in life, the disposition to disorder of the
digestive organs, which had hitherto shown a tendency to terminate
in inflammation of the mucous membrane of the throat,
began to affect other structures; and he became teazed and subsequently
greatly tortured by rheumatism. The disorder so termed
(a kind of general name for various conditions of disorder very
different from each other, and which occasionally affect, not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
joints, but other structures) is in many cases, as we all know,
extremely painful; and is never more excruciating than when
muscular parts thus conditioned are affected by spasm. These
spasms were a source of much acute suffering to Abernethy.
His constant occupations gave him no opportunity of relieving
himself from work, except there was that accommodation of indisposition
to convenient times, which of course seldom happens.</p>

<p>In the early parts of his life, Abernethy, when he was out of
health, would take the first opportunity which his occupations
allowed of going a little way into the country; and there, by
diet, and amusing himself by reading and exercise, he would
soon get well. But as he advanced in life, he was not so ready
to attend to himself as perhaps he ought to have been. Besides,
he would occasionally do things which incurred unnecessary risks,
which we ourselves have sometimes ventured to mention to him.</p>

<p>Living, at the time to which we are now alluding, in Ely
Place, and attending his lectures long after we had commenced
practice, we frequently walked down with him to lecture; sometimes
in the rain, when we used to think his knee-breeches and
silk stockings looked most uncomfortable. Besides this, he was
very careless about his umbrella; I never recollect him on such
occasions calling a coach, and I hardly ever knew him come down
to his evening lecture in his carriage. He generally came to the
two-o'clock lecture some minutes before the time; and, as he
often complained of cold feet, he would stand opposite one of the
flue openings in the Museum. One day, I ventured to suggest
to him that the transition of temperature to the cold place he
occupied in the theatre rendered this hardly prudent, when he
said, "Ay!" and moved away. Though temperate, without
being very particular in his diet, these other imprudences were
unfortunate; because we saw him, every year almost, becoming
troubled more and more by his painful visitor. The time, however,
was now arriving when he was about to resign the Surgeoncy
of the hospital.</p>

<p>We have seen that, when elected to that appointment, he had
been no less than twenty-eight years assistant surgeon; he, however,
took no pains to indemnify himself for this long and profitless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
tenure of a subordinate post; but, mindful of what he had
himself suffered, immediately on his appointment he did the best
he could at once to provide against others being subjected to such
an unrequited service. He accordingly, on his election, addressed
a letter to the Governors of the Hospital, of which, when the first
edition went to press, we had no copy. As we then stated, our
friend, Mr. E. A. Lloyd, a friend and favourite pupil of Abernethy's,
had found one, and kindly laid it aside for us; but he
unfortunately again mislaid it; and there is no copy of it on the
books of the hospital. Subsequently, Mr. Pettigrew has most
kindly sent us a volume containing the letter in question. To us
it is a very interesting document; but as we had already mentioned
the most important fact in it, we have not thought it
necessary to reprint the letter. We must not fail to repeat
publicly our thanks to Mr. Pettigrew for his kind assistance.</p>

<p>The object of the letter was to recommend some alteration in
the arrangement of the duties of the surgeons of the hospital; and,
amongst other things, that they should resign at the age of sixty,
with a retiring salary. Nothing could, we think, be more just or
considerate than such a proposal; and it came very well from
Abernethy, who had just stepped into the lucrative appointment.
The proposal, however, was not acted upon; and it would appear
that his successors, however much they may have at the time approved
of the precept, have not been in haste to follow the example.
There is little doubt that Abernethy's proposal was as
just and considerate of the interests of all parties, as it was in
favour of those of science. We cannot think that any one, who
considers the whole subject without prejudice, will arrive at any
other conclusion.</p>

<p>The absence, however, of any law on the subject, made no
difference to Abernethy; he had expressed his own intention of
resigning at the age of sixty; and when that time arrived, he
accordingly did so. The Governors, however, would not, on that
occasion, accept his resignation, but requested him to continue.
This he did for about another year, when, in 1827&mdash;having been
elected in 1815,&mdash;he finally resigned the hospital, in the following
letter, addressed to the President of the Hospital:</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span></p>


<blockquote>
<p class="sigright in0">"St. Bartholomew's Hospital,&#8195;<br />
"July 24, 1827.</p>

<p>"Finding myself incompetent to discharge the duties of surgeon
to your Hospital in a satisfactory manner, and having led
my junior to believe that I should resign my office at a certain
period of my life, I hereby tender my resignation accordingly.
At the same time, I beg leave to assure the Governors
of my gratitude for their appointment to the offices which I have
held under them, and for the good opinion and confidence which
they have manifested towards me. I annex a draft for £100
for the use of the Hospital.</p>

<p class="sigright in0">"I am, dear Sir,&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;<br />
"Your obedient servant,&#8195;<br />
"<span class="smcap">John Abernethy</span>."</p>

<p class="sigleft in0">"To Rowland Stephenson, Esq."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>At the next meeting of the "Court" of Governors, it was
proposed by Dr. Latham, seconded by Mr. Wells, and unanimously
resolved:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"That this Court accept, with great regret, the resignation of
Mr. Abernethy as one of its Surgeons, an office which he has
discharged with consummate ability for forty years; and the Court
offers him their best, their most unanimous, and warmest thanks
for his very long and important services.</p>

<p class="sigleft in0">"July 25, 1827."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>There is something significant in this vote of thanks, merging
his long period of assistant surgeon in the general expression of
his services as surgeon. It is very suggestive of the influence
which had been felt from the presence of his master mind, although
so long in a position which necessarily restricted its useful energies
in regard to hospital matters. We have little doubt that,
had Abernethy become surgeon to the hospital at a time of life
when his physical energies were unimpaired, he would have suggested
many improvements on the system; but, with little real
power in this respect, and with men who were opposed to him, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
was just the last man in the world to commence a crusade against
the opinions of those with whom he was associated. The moment
he became surgeon, we see him endeavouring to remove an
evil from which he had greatly suffered, and which is obviously a
most undesirable state of things; namely, that men should so
often arrive at a post in which their active energies are most
required, at a time of life when those energies have been, perhaps,
necessarily addressed to other objects, have become weary with
hope deferred, or already on the wane.</p>

<p>He was, also, very averse to so spacious a portion of the hospital
being devoted to the festive meetings of the Governors;
and, on showing it, would sometimes go so far as to say&mdash;"Ay,
this is what I call the useless portion of the hospital." He
continued to lecture another year, when he resigned the lectures;
and, in 1829, his appointment at the College of Surgeons also.</p>

<p>In May, 1829, he wrote to Mr. Belfour, the Secretary of the
College of Surgeons (whose politeness and attention in facilitating
our inquiries at the College we are happy thus publicly to acknowledge),
as follows:</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="sigleft in0">"My dear Sir,</p>

<p>"Early in April, the thermometer was above 70°, and I had
so violent a relapse of rheumatism, that I have not been able
(nor am I now able) to leave this place since that time. Apologize
to the President, therefore, for my non-attendance on
Monday. <i>Entre nous</i>: as I think I shall not be able to perform
the duties of those situations which I now hold at the College,
I think of resigning them; yet I will not decide till I have
talked with Clift<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor"><sup>87</sup></a> upon it. If he could come down this or the
following Saturday, I should be glad to see him.</p>

<p class="sigright in0">"I remain, my dear Sir,&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;<br />
"Yours very sincerely,&#8195;<br />

"To Edmund Belfour, Esq."</p>
</blockquote>


          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span></p>

<p>He accordingly, in July of 1829, resigned his seat at the
Court of Examiners, when the following Memorial was sent him
by the Court of Examiners:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"At the College, at the Court holden on Friday, the 17th of
July, 1829:</p>

<p>"Present: Mr. Thomas, President; Mr. Headington, Mr.
Keate, Vice-Presidents; Sir William Blizard, Mr. Lynn, Sir A.
Cooper, Bart., Sir A. Carlisle, Mr. Vincent, and Mr. Guthrie:</p>

<p>"Resolved, that the following Memorial be entered in the
minutes of this Court:</p>

<p>"Conscious of having been enlightened by the scientific labours
of Mr. Abernethy; convinced that teachers of anatomy,
physiology, and of surgery (and consequently their pupils),
have derived most important information from these sources of
knowledge; and impressed that the healing art has been eminently
advanced by the writings of that excellent individual;
the Members of the Court of Examiners lament the tendered
resignation of an associate so endowed, and whose conduct in
the Court has always been so exemplary.</p>

<p>"Resolved also, that a copy of the foregoing Memorial be
delivered by the Secretary to Mr. Abernethy."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>He had by this time become a great sufferer&mdash;walked very
lamely; and this difficulty, interfering more than ever with his
exercise, no doubt tended to make matters worse. He consulted
nobody, I believe, but his old friend Dr. Roberts, of St. Bartholomew's.
He was induced to go for some time into the country;
and on his return, hearing that he was again in Bedford Row,
and not having seen him for some time, I called on him one
morning, about eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>I knew that he had been very ill; but I was not in the least
prepared to see him so altered. When I was shown into his
room, I was so struck with his appearance, that it was with difficulty
I concealed the emotion it occasioned; but I felt happy in
observing that I had succeeded.</p>

<p>He appeared, all at once as it were, to have become a very old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
man; he was much thinner; his features appeared shrunk. He had
always before worn a good deal of powder; but his hair, which
used to hang rather thickly over his ears, was now thin, and, as
it appeared to me, silvered by age and suffering.</p>

<p>There was the same expressive eye which I had so often seen
lit up by mirth or humour, or animated by some more impassioned
feeling, looking as penetrating and intellectual as ever, but
with a calmness and languor which seemed to tell of continued
pain, and which I had never seen before. He was sitting at a
table, on a sort of stool, as it appeared to me, and had been seeing
patients, and there were still several waiting to see him. On
asking him how he was, his reply was very striking.</p>

<p>It was indeed the same voice which I had so often listened to
with pleasure; but the tone was exceedingly changed. It was
the subdued character which is expressive of recent suffering, and
sounded to me most mournfully. "Ay," say he, "this is very
kind of you&mdash;very kind indeed!" And he somewhat distressed
me by repeating this several times, so that I hardly knew what to
reply. He said he was better, and that he could now walk pretty
fairly again, "as," said he, "you shall see."</p>

<p>He accordingly slowly dismounted from his seat, and, with the
aid of two sticks, began to walk; but it was a melancholy sight
to me. I had never seen him nearly so lame before.</p>

<p>I asked him what he was going to do. He said he was going
to Enfield on the morrow, and that he did not think he should
return. I suggested that he might possibly try a drier air with
more advantage; that I feared Enfield might be a little low and
damp, and not, possibly, the best place for him. "Well," he
said, "anything is better than this." I very shortly after took
my leave; not sorry to be again alone; for I felt considerably
depressed by the unexpected impressions I had received from this
interview. It was too plain that his powers were rapidly waning.
He went to Enfield on the following day (a Wednesday, I think),
and never returned again to practice. He lingered about another
year, during which time I once went to see him, when I found
him something better. He was able to see his friends occasionally,
and at times seemed to rally. In the spring, however, of 1831,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
he gradually got weaker, and died on the 20th of April in that
year.</p>

<p>He perfectly retained his consciousness to the last, and died
as tranquilly as possible. In exhausted conditions of the body,
persons will sometimes linger much longer than the medical
attendant had considered possible; in other cases, the flickering
lamp becomes extinguished many days before they had been apprehensive
of immediate danger. The latter was the case with
Mr. Abernethy. Dr. Roberts had just been to see him; and the
family, who scarcely ever left him, had followed the Doctor down
into the dining room, anxious to hear his report. This, although
it gave them no hope as to the ultimate result, expressed no apprehension
of immediate danger. On returning to Mr. Abernethy,
but a few minutes had elapsed when he gently laid his head back
and expired; but with such entire absence of any struggle, alteration
of countenance, or other indication, that for a short time it
was difficult to realize the fact that he was no more. His body
was not examined; but, from the history and symptoms of his
case, there could be little doubt that there would have been found
organic changes, in which the valvular structures of the heart had
more or less participated.</p>

<p>He was buried in the parish church of Enfield. The funeral
was a private one; and there is a plain tablet on the wall over his
vault, with the following inscription:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
</div>


<blockquote>
<p>"It is as much commendation as any man can bear, to own him excellent;
all beyond it is idolatry."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Dryden.</span></p>
</blockquote>


<p>It has been stated by an acute observer that it was impossible
for any man to be with Abernethy, even for a short time, without
feeling that he was in communion with no common mind; and it
was just, I think, the first effect he produced. In person, he was
of middle stature, and well proportioned for strength and activity.
He had a most interesting countenance; it combined the character
of a philosopher and a philanthropist, lighted up by cheerfulness
and humour. It was not that his features were particularly well
formed or handsome, though there was not a bad one in the whole
countenance; but the harmony of composition (if we may be
allowed the expression) was so perfect.</p>

<p>A sufficiently high and ample forehead towered over two of
the most observant and expressive eyes I almost ever saw. People
differ about colour; they appeared to me always of a greyish-blue,
and were characterized as the rule by a mirthful yet piercing expression,
from which an overlaying of benevolence was seldom
wanting; yet, as we have before observed, they would sometimes
launch forth gleams of humour, anger, or pathos, as the case might
be, which were such as the term dramatic can alone convey.</p>

<p>There was another expression of his eye which was very characteristic;
it was when his benevolence was excited without the
means of gratifying it, as would sometimes happen in the case of
hospital patients, for whom he wanted good air, and things which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
their position did not allow them to procure. He would in this
case step a pace or two from the bed, throw his head a little aside,
and, talking to the dresser, exhibit an expression of deep feeling
which was extremely peculiar; it was a mixture of suffering, of
impatience, and sympathy; but the force which the scene drew
from the dramatic character of his expressive countenance is entirely
lost in the mere relation. If, at such times, he gave utterance
to a few words, they were always extremely touching and
expressive. On an occasion, for example, like the following, these
characters were combined. A woman came into the hospital to
have an operation performed; and Abernethy, as was his invariable
custom, took some time to get her health into a more favourable
condition. When the day for the operation was at hand, the
dresser informed him that she was about to quit the hospital.</p>

<p>"Why, my good woman," said Abernethy, "what a fool you
must be to come here to have an operation performed; and
now, just as you are in a fit state for it, to go out again."
Somebody here whispered to him that her father in the country
"was dying." With a burst of indignation, his eyes flashing fire,
he turned to the dresser, and said: "You fool, why did you not
tell me this before?" Then, after a moment or two looking at
the patient, he went from the foot up to the side of the bed, and
said in the kindest tone possible: "Yes, my good woman, you
shall go out immediately; you may come back again when you
please, and I will take all the care I can of you."</p>

<p>Now there was nothing in all this, perhaps; but his manner
gave it immense force. And I remember one of the old pupils
saying to me: "How kind he was to that woman; upon my
soul, I could hardly help crying."</p>

<p>Abernethy exemplified a very rare and powerful combination
of intellectual qualities. He had a perception of the facts of a
subject at once rapid, penetrating, and comprehensive, and a
power of analysis which immediately elicited those relations which
were most important to the immediate objects of the investigation;
a power, of course, of the utmost value in a practical profession.</p>

<p>This faculty was never more marvellously displayed than
sometimes in doubtful or difficult cases; and this had been always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
a striking excellence in him, even when a young man. I recollect
hearing my father say, that to see Abernethy to advantage, you
must observe him when roused by some difficulty, and in a case
where other men were at fault, or puzzled. It was just so; his
penetrating mind seemed to remove to either side at once what
was foreign or doubtful, and go straight to the point with which
alone he had to grapple. Allied to this, if not part of it, was
that suggestive power which he possessed in so remarkable a
degree, and which by a kind of intuition seemed to single out
those pertinent relations and inquiries which the judgment is to
examine, and reject, or approve, as the case may be; a faculty
absolutely necessary to success in endeavours at extending the
boundaries of a science. He was thus sometimes enabled, as
has been shown, to convert facts to the highest purposes, in aid
of practical improvement, which, with an ordinary observer, would
have passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>These qualities, combined with a memory, as we have seen,
peculiarly ready, capacious, and retentive, placed his resources at
once at hand for practical application. Then, while his quick
perception of relation always supplied him with abundant analogies,
his imaginative faculty enabled him to illustrate, enforce,
and adorn them with such a multitude and variety of illustration
as seemed well-nigh inexhaustible.</p>

<p>Of his humour we have already spoken; but the same properties
which served him so well in more important matters were
really, as it appears to us, the foundation of much of that humour
by which his conversation was characterized&mdash;we mean his quick
perception of relation, and his marvellously retentive memory.
Many of the things that he said, "told," not because they were
original, so much as that they were ready at hand; not because
they were intrinsically good, as so apposite in application; and,
lastly, because they were further assisted by his inimitable manner.
Nevertheless, sometimes his quick perception would be
characterized by a corresponding felicity of expression. Bartleman
was an intimate friend of Abernethy's; and those who remember
the magnificent voice and peculiarly chaste style of that
celebrated singer, will appreciate the felicity of the expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
applied to him by Abernethy, when he said, "Bartleman is an
orator in music."</p>

<p>Abernethy had the talent of conveying, by his manner, and
apparently without the smallest effort, that which in the drama is
scarcely known but as the result of constant and careful study.
It was a manner which no analysis of his character can convey,
of which none of his own compositions even give an adequate
idea. The finest colours are often the most fugitive. This is
just the case with that heightened expression which we term
dramatic. Who can express in words the thrilling effect that an
earnest, heartfull delivery of a single phrase has sometimes conveyed.
But brilliant as these endowments were, they were graced
by moral qualities of the first order.</p>

<p>Quick as he was to see everything, he was necessarily rapid in
his perception of character, and would sometimes at a glance hit
on the leading influence of this always difficult assemblage of
phenomena, with the same rapidity that marked his dealings with
facts which were the more usual objects of his inquiries. But,
though quick in his perception of character, and therefore rapidly
detective of faults, his views were always tempered by generosity
and good sense. Indignant at injustice and oppression, and intolerant
only of baseness or cruelty, he was kind and charitable
in his construction of more common or excusable failings.</p>

<p>He loved man as his brother, and, with enlarged ideas of the
duties of benevolence, never dispensed it as a gift which it was
creditable to bestow, so much as an obligation which it would
have been immoral to have omitted. It was not that he did
anything which the world calls noble or great in giving sums of
money to this or that person. There were, indeed, plenty of
instances of that sort of generosity and benevolence, which
would creep out, in spite of him, from those whom he had
benefited; and no man knew how to do it better. A gentleman,
for example, came up from the country to the school, and went
to Bedford Row, to enter the lectures. Abernethy asked him a
few questions about his intentions and his prospects, and found
that his proceedings would be little doubtful, as they were contingent
on the receipt of some funds which were uncertain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
Abernethy gave him a perpetual ticket to all his own lectures.
"And what made so much impression on me," said the gentleman,
"was, that instead of paying me less attention, in asking me to
his house, than the other pupils, if there were any difference,
he paid me rather more." We have seen this gentleman within
a few days, and we are happy to say he has had a happy and
prosperous career.</p>

<p>The benevolence, however, to which we allude, was not merely
shown in giving or remitting money; that, indeed, would be a
marvellous overcoming of the world with many people, but not
with Abernethy; his benevolence was no fitful suggestion of impulse,
but a steadily glowing principle of action, never obtrusive,
but always ready when required. It has been said, "a good man's
life is a constant prayer." It may be asserted that a good
surgeon's life should be a gentle stream of benevolent sympathies,
supporting and distributing the conscientious administration of
the duties of his profession. That this really intrinsic part of
his character should have been occasionally overlaid by unkindness
of manner, is, indeed, much to be regretted; and, we
believe, was subsequently deplored by no one more sincerely than
himself, and those who most loved and respected him. The
faults of ordinary acquaintances are taken as matters of course;
but the errors of those who are the objects of our respect and
affection, are always distressing. We feel them almost as a
personal wrong; and, in a character like Abernethy, where every
spot on so fair a surface became luminously evident, such defects
gave one a feeling of mortification which was at once humiliating
and oppressive. But, whilst we are the last to conceal his failings,
we cannot but think he was, after all, himself the greatest
sufferer; we have no doubt they originated, at least, in good
motives, and that they have been charged, after all, with much
good.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have at all times had too many Gnathos in
our profession, too much of the</p>


<div lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Quidquid dicunt laudo, id rursum si negant, laudo id quoque.</div>
<div class="i0">Negat quis? nego. ait? aio."</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>These assenting flatterers are the bane of an honest man, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
under the name of tact and the influence of an uncompromising
ambition to get on, merge the highest duties into a mere desire to
please; and, adopting the creed of Gnatho, appropriately arrive
at the same climax as their conclusion:</p>


<div lang="la" xml:lang="la">
<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i8">"Postremo imperavi egomet mihi</div>
<div class="i0">Omnia assentari."</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Now, Abernethy knew this well, and detested it with a repulsion
deep and sincere. He had no knowledge of Gnathonics.
He felt that he was called on to practise a profession, the legitimate
object of which was alone achieved when it ministered to
real suffering; and that mere assentation to please patients was a
prostitution of the highest qualities of mind to the lowest purposes.
If one may so say, he felt like a painter who has a feeling
for the highest department of his art, and who could see nothing
in an assenting Gnathonicism but an immoral daub.</p>

<p>Neither was this without use to others; for though he looked,
as the public may be assured many others have done, on a "parcel
of people who came to him with nothing the matter," yet even in
his roughness he was discriminate, and sometimes accomplished
more good than the most successful time-server by all his lubricity.
One day, for example, a lady took her daughter, evidently most
tightly laced&mdash;a practice which we believe mothers now are aware
is mischievous, but scarcely to the extent known to medical men.
She complained of Abernethy's rudeness to her, as well she
might; still he gave her, in a few words, a useful lesson. "Why,
madam," said he, "do you know there are upwards of thirty yards
of bowels squeezed underneath that girdle of your daughter's?
Go home and cut it, let Nature have fair play, and you will
have no need of my advice."</p>

<p>But, if we must acknowledge and regret, as we do, his occasional
rudenesses of manner, let us also give him the credit of overcoming
these besetting impulses. In all hospitals, of course,
there are occasional vexations; but who ever saw Abernethy
really unkind to a hospital patient? Now, we cannot affirm any
thing beyond our own experience. We had, as dresser, for a
considerable period, the care of many of his patients, and we continued
frequently to observe his practice from the commencement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
of our pupilage, which was about a year or a little more after his
appointment as surgeon, until the close of his hospital labours.
We speak subject to correction, therefore, but we cannot charge
our memory with a single instance of unkindness to a hospital
patient; whilst we are deeply impressed by the constant prevalence
of a generally kind and unaffected sympathy with them.</p>

<p>The quickness with which he observed any imperfection in the
execution of his directions, was, on the contrary, the source of
many a "rowing," as we apprehend some of his dressers well
enough remember; whilst he seldom took a dresser without
making more than usual inquiries as to his competency. In
private practice, also, any case that really required skill and discrimination
was pretty sure to meet with the attention that it
deserved. This was noticed in the remarks made on the character
of Abernethy, at the time of his death, by the Duke of Sussex,
at the Royal Society, at their anniversary meeting on the 30th of
November, 1831, of which the following is a report, copied from
the books of the Society:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>His Royal Highness observed that "Mr. Abernethy was one
of those pupils of John Hunter who appears the most completely
to have caught the bold and philosophical spirit of his
great master. He was the author of various works and
memoirs upon physiological and anatomical or surgical subjects,
including papers which have appeared in our Transactions.
Few persons have contributed more abundantly to the establishment
of the true principles of surgery and medical science
in those cases which require that minute criticism of the
symptoms of disease, upon the proper knowledge and study of
which the perfection of medical art must mainly depend.</p>

<p>"As a lecturer, he was not less distinguished than as an
author; and he appears to have attained the art of fixing
strongly the attention of his hearers, not less by the just
authority of his opinions than by his ready command of apt
and forcible illustrations. He enjoyed, during many years of
his life, more than an ordinary share of public favour in the
practice of his profession; and, though not a little remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
for the eccentricities of his manner and an affected roughness
in his intercourse with his ordinary patients, he was generally
kind and courteous in those cases which required the full exercise
of his skill and knowledge, and also liberal in the
extreme when the infliction of poverty was superadded to those
of disease."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The high character of his benevolence was shown also in
the ready forgiveness of injuries; and he was as grateful as he
was forgiving. How constant his attachment to his early friend
and teacher, Sir William Blizard. There is something very
characteristic of this, when, in the decline of life, he writes
"Yours unremittingly," to one whose unusually lengthened years
had enabled him to witness Abernethy's entry into life, and, at
the conclusion of the labours of his distinguished pupil, to join
with a public body in expressing the high sense entertained of
the obligations which he had conferred on science and mankind.
Few men could have been placed in positions more trying than
that in which he found himself in his controversy with Mr.
Lawrence. When the time arrived at which, in the ordinary
course, that gentleman would have been elected into the Council
of the College, there was a very strong feeling on the part of
some of the members against his admission. Abernethy, however,
proposed him himself, and it was by his casting vote that
the election terminated in Mr. Lawrence's favour.</p>

<p>A member of the Council having expressed his surprise that
Mr. Abernethy should propose a gentleman with whom he had
had so unpleasant a difference&mdash;"What has that to do with it?"
rejoined Abernethy. Some friends of Mr. Lawrence wished to
pay that gentleman the compliment of having his portrait drawn,
and a subscription was to be entered into for this purpose. It
was suggested that it would be very desirable to get Mr. Abernethy
to allow his name to be in the list; and our friend, Mr.
Kingdon<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor"><sup>88</sup></a>, with the best intentions no doubt, ventured to ask<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
Mr. Abernethy to put his name at <i>the head</i> of the list. But
there was nothing of Quixotism in Abernethy. He would have
been very glad to do a kind thing to anybody; and any obstacle
affecting him personally was much more likely to be an argument
in favour than otherwise. He liked justice for its own sake; but
he was circumspect as well as penetrative. At first he seemed
inclined to do it, but asked a day to consider of it; and then wrote
the following letter, into a more particular examination of which
we need not enter:</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="sigright in0">"1828–9.</p>

<p class="sigleft in0">"My dear sir,</p>

<p>"'<i>Fiat Justitia</i>' is, as I flatter myself, the rule of my conduct.
At all times have I expressed my approbation and
respect for William Lawrence, on account of his professional
learning, and of his ability as a writer and public speaker.
But, if I do what you would have me, I should do much more,
and be made to appear as a leader in a scheme the object of
which is indefinite; so that persons will be at liberty to put
what construction they please upon my conduct. Being
desirous of doing what you wish, I have been for some time
in a state of perplexity and hesitation.</p>

<p>"At length I have resolved&mdash;that since I cannot determine
what ought to be done&mdash;to follow a useful rule of professional
conduct, and to do nothing. Vexed to refuse you anything, I
hope you will still believe me,</p>

<p class="sigright in0">"My dear sir,&#8195;&#8195;<br />
"Your obliged and very sincere friend,&#8195;<br />
"<span class="smcap">John Abernethy</span>."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The question of how far letters are to be relied on as expositions
of character, has been much discussed.</p>

<p>The remarks of Dr. Johnson on the subject, in his Life of
Pope, are put with great force, and almost carry us with him;
but, on reflection, they appear too general; they do not, perhaps,
get close enough to the question in which the student in
Biography is chiefly interested.</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span></p>

<p>Although letters obviously afford opportunities for a variety
of affectation&mdash;and Pope seems to have seldom been quite natural&mdash;yet
we cannot think that "friendship has no tendency to produce
veracity." But it seems impossible to generalize on the
subject. We might as well ask whether oral evidence is to be
relied on. There is no one quality that we can think of that can
be said to be so universally distributed in letters as to be safe to
generalize on. Common sense tells us that the testimony they
give may be false or true. They are, like witnesses, capable of
telling truth, but having, under different circumstances, all the
characters of all other kinds of witnesses. Strictly, the dependence
one would place on them would be on the abstract probability
of that which they suggest; or as supported by any corroborative
evidence.</p>

<p>The following is a note to his daughter, the late Mrs. Warburton,
thanking her for a watch-chain:</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="sigright in0">"Bedford Row,&#8195;<br />
"Sept. 30.</p>

<p>"I am quite accablé by the liberality of the Dr. and yourself;
but I've been thinking that the Dr. is leading me into temptation,
and that you are spending your money for an ornament
which will never be seen, and which will only increase my
apprehensions of having my pocket picked. However, what is
meant in kindness should be received according to its design.
Thus occasionally shall I taste the old rum; though, according
to the phrase of the Doctor's schoolfellow (who reiterated that
the wine was capital), blue ruin might have done as well. Thus
also shall I wear the chain in remembrance of a chain which
attaches me to you; one forged by Nature, and riveted by your
good conduct and excellent disposition.</p>

<p>The following has some points of interest. The reason why
merciful; the observance of approved custom in shutting up the
house; yet connecting so much of "forms, modes, shows of
grief," as Hamlet calls them, with the best feelings, because
"she had loved you," &amp;c.; the gentle tenderness with which
he alludes to the excellence of the Mother; and the graceful
compliment with which he concludes; seem excellent teaching.</p>

<p class="sigleft in0">"My dear Anne,</p>

<p>"I am much concerned to tell you that your Grandmother
died last night, about nine o'clock. Death came to her unattended
with pain or terrors. It is highly probable that she
neither felt uneasiness of body or mind, from the time she was
first seized with the fit. To have lived to her age, respectably
and respected, in health, and to die without bodily or mental
sufferings, is a fate which falls but to the lot of few; so that
her friends have no reason to repine at her death; and it seems
to be a merciful dispensation of Providence. If the servant
has left Putney for Radcliff, of course the house is shut up; if
not, it ought to be so. You and the children ought also to
stay within doors, and have the front windows closed. She
loved you all very much, and you ought to love and respect her
memory. To you, who are apt to indulge your feelings too
much, I must add, that it would be wrong to grieve much for
what is in reality, as I have said, a cause to rejoice. I mean
that the pains and decrepitude of age should be spared to the
Individual whose fate we mourn. I have always esteemed it
an excellence in your Mother's character, that though she feels
acutely, yet she bears her lot in the dispensations of Providence
with a gentleness and submission which indeed serve to diminish
their severity. I trust she will do so on this occasion.
You will see her to-morrow at Putney, if not before. On all
occasions, and under every circumstance, rely on it that I

<p class="center bold in0">TO MRS. ABERNETHY.</p>


<blockquote>
<p class="sigleft in0">"Dearest,</p>

<p>"The first incident worth relating happened at Cirencester.
I hobbled in haste to Mr. Lawrence's; his dressing room was
open, and articles of apparel, &amp;c. lay about, as if he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
lately engaged in the (to some agreeable, to others annoying)
operation of dressing himself. His maid servant, however,
sought him in vain, even in the church-yard. She looked
mysterious and alarmed. 'Perhaps,' said I, 'he is gone to Mr.
Warner's.' Sure enough there he was, examining a shoulder
said to have been dislocated; and he would make me examine
it likewise. So much time having been lost as to the object of
my visit, I had merely time to tell him that you were at Cheltenham,
and would come to see him; and he to tell me that
Mrs. Lawrence was at Malvern. The guard sounded his tin
horn in an imperative manner; the sound was repeated, and I
received a verbal reproof from the coachman for not instantly
obeying the summons. A little way out of Cirencester, on the
road to Tetbury, there is a neat and stile-ish house and grounds
which I anticipated belonged to Charles Lawrence; and my
presentiment was confirmed by a Compagnon de Voyage. Arrived
at the York House, Bath, I was shown into a bed-room
which had not been dusted, as you would think, properly since
a fortnight before the fire. So, with the fear of bugs and other
blood-sucking insects, I took up those of the papilionacious
tribe belonging to Mr. Marriott, and proceeded to his abode;
approaching which, I encountered Mr. Wood. By his recommendation,
I procured apartments in a house, as Bourdillon
would say, the entirety of which could only be obtained by
persons in general. Behold me, then, sole occupant of a spacious
and well-furnished house (being No. 9, St. James's Square),
with a garden terminating in a road, beyond which fields only
are visible, and within ken of the brow of Lansdown. The
front and back rooms communicate, and the windows of each
being open, there is perflation in excess. (Diary.) Monday.
Descending Gay Street, in my way to the bath, I called at
Soden's, and found him in great distress, and that Hodgson
had gone forth to seek for me. Mrs. Soden is very ill, and
Hodgson had come once to see her. She has lots of medical
attendants, who, to use &mdash;&mdash;'s phrase, dovetail their opinions
and practice before they prescribe for their patient. In perambulating
Bath with Mr. Hodgson, we encountered Mr. Leifchild,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
who recited his case to the former, in proof of the efficacy
of diet, with the eloquence of a public orator; and it happened
to be a case in point. I scrubbed myself for half an hour, and
drank half a pint of water at the pump room; then reascended
the hill; looked in at Wilson Brown's, whose wife is quite well.
No doubt the state of her digestive organs was the source of
her various maladies. Her father, Dr. Chichester, whom you
saw at Mr. Acres', now resides at Cheltenham. I went with
Mr. Brown to the Riding School, thinking that if I could meet
with a kind of shooting pony, I might be tempted to get on
his back. But I escaped temptation, dined on mutton chop or
chops, drank half a pint of ale, felt quiet, dosed a little. Descended
to Queen Square; left a card for Sir George Gibbs, who
is at Weymouth; called on Mr. Gore, who had been called out
to a casualty (Bath phrase); went to the White Hart, found
the coach did not come in until nine o'clock; thinking that
if I did not see Mr. Battiscombe until then, we should both be
as weary of seeing each other as of the day's toil, I reascended
the hill, and went to bed. It was necessary that a day should
elapse, that I might tell you how time passed; so that I have
complied with your request of writing as soon as possible. No
doubt that the days will be so monotonous as to render a second
account unnecessary. I calculate I shall be tout-à-fait ennuyé
in a fortnight; so that I expect I shall set off to Cheltenham,
in the coach I came by, next Monday sennight, which I believe
will arrive there about eight or nine in the evening, when I hope
to find you all well. On Friday I think we might visit Oxford,
and house ourselves again at the Angel; from whence, if we
start at nine, we may be in London by four o'clock on Saturday.</p>

<p>"I think I have written a ladylike letter: no attempt at condensation.
I hope to hear from you in return, and that you
will be able to say all's well. I will write to Anne to-morrow,
because you say she wishes it&mdash;perhaps to-day.</p>

<p>He was fond of joining in anything that could delight and
amuse his children. In summer, when he returned home, the
"upstairs bell" was generally the signal for the young people to
come to have a game of play. Of games, battledore and
shuttlecock was a favourite, at which he was as expert and pleased
as any of them. Sometimes there would be a petition for stories;
and he would delight them all by little histories or tales, in which
he appears to have shown the same talent as he did in his lectures.
The same stories were often repeated, yet they always had something
of the fun or freshness, as the case might be, of things
that were heard for the first time. One Christmas, the family,
desirous of amusing some friends, proposed to get up some
private theatricals. The anxious question being, what papa
would say to it? Well, this was very soon known, by a ready
assent. But what was the play to be? They replied, "The Iron
Chest." But now rather an important difficulty arose, of who
was to take the part of Sir Edward Mortimer? This was as
unexpectedly as joyfully solved, by Mr. Abernethy taking it
himself.</p>

<p>But, of all the home sports to which he seems to have given
such zest, all yielded to the superior attractions of the Magic lantern.
This was generally a gambol reserved for Christmas, when the
whole establishment were admitted. The fun lay in the number
and variety of the stories and remarks which accompanied the
optical illustrations.</p>

<p>Every "slide" had remarks and stories made off-hand, which,
as stories were of this or that kind, either greatly increased the
interest or were the occasion of hearty merriment or peals of
laughter.</p>

<p>He was very fond of the country and his garden, and nothing
he enjoyed more than driving down to Enfield with Mr. Clift, and
having a holiday. On such occasions, sometimes, even before he
went into the house he would set to work in the garden. They used
both to be very active in cutting out the dead wood from the
laurels and other shrubs. In these domestic operations the
children would assist without any of the party recollecting that
bonnets and gowns were not the best costume for making way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
amongst the trees and shrubs, which, however, only assisted to
increase the fun and excitement. At other times, there would
be an expedition against the duck-weed on the water. In short, he
always seems to have been the life of the party, and to have
invested even the most ordinary occupations with liveliness and
interest, for which he was certainly gifted with unwonted powers.
Occasionally he would go to the theatre, which he sometimes
enjoyed very much. Like his brother, he was a great lover of
our immortal Shakspeare, and scarcely less familiar with most of
the wonderful creations of his mighty genius.</p>

<p>When we contemplate Abernethy in a single phase only of
his character, we see a "fidgetty" physical organization, influencing
an habitual irritability of which it was too much a supporter,
if it were not the original cause; but the moment we penetrate
this thin and only occasional covering, we meet with nothing but
rare and splendid endowments; and, as we proceed in our examination,
we are at a loss which most to admire, the brilliant
qualities of his intellect, or the moral excellences of his heart.</p>

<p>But, in estimating the one or the other, we must view them
in relation to the other feelings with which they were accompanied,
as impeding or assisting their development and application; or
otherwise we shall hardly estimate in its due force the powers of
that volition over which the moral sense so constantly presides.</p>

<p>Abernethy had considerable love of approbation&mdash;a quality
which, regarded in a religious point of view, may be said to embrace
all others; but it is one which, in the ordinary relations of
life, is apt to dilute the character, bringing down the mind from
the contemplation of more elevated motives to the level of those
suggested by worldly considerations and conventionalisms. To
one shy, even to timidity, and whose organization fitted him
rather for the rapid movements of a penetrative and impulsive
perception, than the more dogged perseverance of sustained labour,
love of approbation, even in the ordinary application of it, might
have been a useful stimulus in maintaining exertion; and we
believe it was. Yet, though he avowed it as a dominant
principle in our nature, as the great "incentive" to human action,
he never sought it but by legitimate channels; nor, potential as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
its influences might have been, when sharpened by shyness and
timidity, did he hesitate one moment to throw them all aside
whenever the interests of truth or justice rendered it necessary.</p>

<p>When Mr. Hunter's views were little noticed, less understood,
and apparently in danger of being forgotten&mdash;when the more
speculative of his views were not even known as his by any <i>published</i>
documents&mdash;when, therefore, in addition to other objections, he
was, as we have seen, subjected to the imputation of advocating
opinions as Hunter's, of which there was no other testimony
than the precarious memories of contemporaries,&mdash;he stood boldly
forward as the fearless, earnest, and eloquent advocate of John
Hunter. In this case, he overcome his natural dislike to contest
and publicity, and encountered just that individualizing opposition
which is most trying to a sensitive organization; exemplifying a
rare tribute of truth and justice paid by genius to the claims of
a departed brother. At the same time, the power he displayed
of moulding views, scarcely even acknowledged, into the elementary
beginnings of little less than a new science, strikingly testifies
the superiority of his intellectual power.</p>

<p>Whilst, however, he advocated John Hunter's views, and,
with a creative spirit, made them the basis of additional structures
which were emphatically his own, we find him modestly reverting
again and again to John Hunter, as if afraid of not awarding him
his just due,&mdash;and for ever linking both the early bud put forth
by Hunter's inquiries and the opening blossom afforded by his
own, with the imperishable efforts of his distinguished master,&mdash;exemplifying
the modesty of genius, and how superior it is, when
guided by virtue, to any but the most exalted motives.</p>

<p>Another example of his independence of mind and of his
conquest over difficulty, when the interests of truth appeared to
him to render it necessary, was the manner in which, in defiance
of ridicule and all sorts of opposition, he advocated his own
views; with ultimate success, it is true, but obtained only through
a variety of difficulties, greatly augmented by his naturally shy,
if not timid, organization. Still, amidst all his brilliant endowments,
we feel ourselves fondly reverting to the more peaceful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
unobtrusive efforts with which he daily inculcated the conscientious
study of an important profession.</p>

<p>That he had faults, is of course true; but they were not the
faults of the spirit so much as of the clay-bound tenement in
which it resided&mdash;not so much those of the individual man as
those necessarily allied to humanity. The powerful influences of
education had not been very happily applied in Abernethy; its
legitimate office is, no doubt, to educe the good, and suppress the
evolution of bad qualities. In Abernethy, we can hardly help
thinking that his education was more calculated to do just the
contrary. "To level a boy with the earth," because he ventured
on "a crib to Greek Testament," is, to say the least of it, very
questionable discipline for a shy and irritable organization. To
restore to its original form the tree which has been bent as a
sapling, is always difficult or impossible.</p>

<p>But, in virtue of those beneficent laws which "shelter the
shorn lamb," Abernethy was allowed ultimately, less in consequence
than in spite of his education, to develop one of the most
benevolent of dispositions. To this was joined a powerful conscientiousness,
which pervaded everything he did, and which
could hardly be supported but by sentiments of religious responsibility;
and it is certain that his mind was deeply imbued with
the precepts of a vital Christianity, that took the most practical
view of his duty to God and to his neighbour; and, in the very
imperfect sense in which human nature has ever attained to the
full obedience of either, he regarded a humble and practical
observance of the one as the best human exposition of the other.
His favourite apothegm on all serious occasions, and especially in
those parts of his profession where its guidance was most required,
was the divine precept of doing to others as we would wish done
to ourselves.</p>

<p>In his reflections he strikingly exemplifies how humble and
single-minded were his modes of thinking. After the manner
of Bishop Butler, but with a simplicity highly characteristic, he
identifies that which is truly religious with that which is truly
philosophical; and, instead of finding difficulties in those barriers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
which necessarily lie before finite capacities, when endeavouring
to approach the Infinite, he seems to regard them as things which
rather direct and limit, than obstruct, legitimate inquiry.</p>

<p>In concluding this imperfect sketch of a difficult character,
we have merely endeavoured to state our own impressions.
We cannot help thinking that Abernethy has left a space which
yet remains unoccupied; it would be presumptuous to say that
it will long continue so. In his life he has left us an excellent
example to follow, nor has it been less useful in teaching us that
which we should avoid.</p>

<p>Whilst amongst us, as he taught us how to exercise some
important duty, he would occasionally endeavour to impress
matters of detail, by showing, first, how they should not be
done. His life instructs us after the same manner. In all
serious matters, we may generally take him as a guide; in
occasional habits, we may most safely recollect that faults are
no less faults&mdash;as Mirabeau said of Frederick&mdash;because they
have the "shadow" of a great name; and we believe that, were
it possible, no good man would desire to leave a better expiation
of any weakness, than that it should deter others from a similar
error. This is the view we would wish our young friends to take
of the matter. We cannot all reach the genius of Abernethy,
but we may be animated by the same spirit.</p>

<p>If great men are endowed with powers given only to the few,
their success generally turns on the steady observance of the
more homely qualities which are the common privilege of the
many&mdash;caution, circumspection, industry, and humility. Again,
genius is often charged with weaknesses by which more ordinary
minds are unfettered or unembarrassed. We may emulate the
justice, the independence of mind, the humanity, the generosity,
the modesty, and, above all, the conscientiousness of Abernethy,
in all serious cases; without withholding from the more ordinary
and lighter duties of our profession a due proportion of these
feelings, or necessarily laying aside the forbearance and courtesy
which must ever lend an additional grace to our various duties.</p>

<p>We may endeavour with all our power to avoid a disgraceful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
flattery and compliancy, without replacing them by contrasts
which, though not equally mischievous, we may be assured are
equally unnecessary: whilst we may, in our various stations,
emulate his kindness, his constancy as a husband, father, and
friend; and yet not refuse a becoming share of such endearing
qualities to others, from any fear that we shall be subject to misconstruction.</p>

<p>We may remember that intellect alone is dry, cold, and calculating;
that feeling, unsupported or uncontrolled, is impulsive,
paroxysmal, and misleading; and that the few rare moments of
moral excellence which human nature achieves, are, when these
powers combine, in harmony of purpose and unity of action.</p>

<p>We may be assured that, however much we admire that rapid
and searching perceptivity,&mdash;that sound, acute, and comprehensive
judgment which Abernethy brought to bear on the study of the
profession,&mdash;or the honourable, independent, generous, and
humane manner in which he administered its more important and
serious duties,&mdash;the greatest, and, for good, the most potential
influence of all, was the manner in which he employed his manifold
and varied excellences as a teacher in endeavouring to infuse a truly
conscientious spirit into the numbers who, as pupils, he sent forth
to practise in all parts of the world. This is still an unknown
amount of obligation. Those resulting from his works may be
proximately calculated, and such as are necessarily omitted in a
review essentially popular, <i>may be chronicled hereafter in a more
suitable manner</i>; but, as a teacher, we cannot as yet calculate
the amount of our obligations to him. They are only to be
estimated by reflection; and by recollecting the <i>moral influence of
every man</i> who honestly practises an important profession.</p>

<p>Finally, whether we think of the interests of the public, the
profession, or those of each, as affecting the other, or of both as
affecting the progress of society; we shall, I think, be disposed to
agree with one of our most distinguished modern writers, that
the "means on which the interests and prospects of society most
depend, are the sustained influence that invariably attends the
dignity of private virtue."</p>

          <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389&ndash;390</a></span></p>

<p>In a world which presents so much of violated faith and
broken ties, the mind experiences a grateful repose in the contemplation
of long and uninterrupted friendship.</p>

<p>Of all men, perhaps Sir William Blizard had known Abernethy
the longest, and loved him the best; and an intercourse of
more than half a century had only served to cement a friendship
entirely reciprocal with sentiments of increased respect and regard.</p>

<p>Sir William had been one of the first to excite in Abernethy
that love for his profession which led to such brilliant
results. He had witnessed his career with all the pleasure that a
teacher regards the success of an early pupil, and no doubt with
that satisfaction which is inseparable from a prediction fulfilled.
He had lived, also, to receive a public and affectionate tribute of
gratitude for his early lessons, when Abernethy was in the zenith
of his power.</p>

<p>Sir William, however, lived nearly a century, and was still
alive and well, when Abernethy's sun was setting, and when that
fire which he had been the first to kindle for such useful and
benevolent purposes was soon to be extinguished for ever.</p>

<p>When Abernethy retired from the College of Surgeons, Sir
William was requested to draw up the memorial in which his
services were to be recorded.</p>

<p>These circumstances invest even formal documents with an
unusual interest; and we therefore trust that Sir William's
encomium may not be thought an inappropriate conclusion to
our humble story.</p>

<p>This almost ancient friend and early instructor observed, of
Abernethy, "that his life has been devoted to the improvement
of the healing art. His luminous writings breathe simplicity,
humanity, reverence of truth, and disdain of worldly art; and
have placed the art and science of surgery on the permanent
basis of anatomy and physiology; whilst the contemplation of
his character excites emulative ideas of public virtue in the
cultivation of useful knowledge."</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote2">
<p>"So many applications are made to us for histories suited to a period of life when
the mind is beginning to develope its power, and to find satisfaction in connecting the
past with the present and the future in human affairs, that we are induced to recommend
these volumes, which, however widely circulated, have not half the circulation
which they deserve. They are clearly written. They neither minister to childish imbecility,
nor take for granted a measure of knowledge which cannot be lawfully expected
of the young. They present the page of history as it really is&mdash;not a series of dry
details, nor of gorgeous spectacles, but with enough of plain fact to instruct the understanding,
and of romantic incident to kindle the sympathies and affections. The German
school of historical doubters are neither listened to by Mrs. Gray as oracles, nor
rejected as impostors. Niebuhr is heard, without, as in some cases, being worshipped.
Those will do little justice to these volumes who regard them as of value only to the
young. We know of no book of the kind in which the upper classes of public schools
may more successfully study those facts of which they are apt to be miserably ignorant,
and in which their fathers may find more suggestive hints for the Pulpit and the
Senate."&mdash;<i>Christian Observer.</i></p>

<p>"We have no hesitation in saying, that this is one of the best histories of the Roman
Empire for children and young people which has come under our notice. Mrs. Hamilton
Gray has made herself acquainted with at least some of the more important ancient
writers on the subject of which she treats, and also with the criticisms of Niebuhr and
other modern investigators of Roman history."&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>"This volume is designed for young children, and its contents are thrown into the

be understood as 'Wonders of Creation,' showing the wisdom and goodness of the
Creator. The illustration of scriptural facts is also continually kept in view, and
suitable moral and religious lessons are drawn. The book is for holiday rather than for
school use, and the forms of conversation are the better preserved by occasional
digressions from the subject immediately in hand."&mdash;<i>Record.</i></p>

<p>"These works are excellent. Miss Tytler's writings are especially valuable for their
religious spirit. She has taken a just position between the Rationalism of the last generation
and the Puritanism of the present, while the perfect nature and true art with
which she sketches from juvenile life, show powers which might be more ambitiously
displayed, but cannot be better bestowed."&mdash;<i>Quarterly Review.</i></p>
